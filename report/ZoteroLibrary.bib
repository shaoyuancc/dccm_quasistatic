  abstract = {Following three decades of progress, improvements in the welfare of children and other vulnerable groups worldwide began to falter in the mid-1970s. World recession, and in particular the debt crisis in Latin America and African famine, have seriously affected economic development programs in less developed countries. At the same time, however, large-scale health programs have had a noticeable impact. This study both illustrates the extent of the current crisis and points to the successes to show how welfare policies can--and must--become part of national planning even when the economy is in crisis.},

  abstract = {internalexternalideological In the fight against HIV/AIDS, the Behavior Change Communication (BCC) model stands as international best practice in preventive education. Ideally, a BCC intervention aims to changes behaviors and attitudes by facilitating group negotiation and introspection, with a resultant improvement in health. However, introducing this best practice model to a group of youth in Nairobi resulted in suboptimal outcomes: they were unaccustomed to expressing themselves in the ways prescribed by the class. To explain this failure, I examine how local discourses produced by parents and teachers communicate agency, sexuality and health, and highlight the diverging practices invoked at home, school and by the BCC model to make these youth ‘health conscious’. At home and at school, the key commonality was the absence of any attempt to inculcate internal reasoning – in contrast to the BCC model. Rather, they relied on external pressures, through repetition, silence and behavioral discipline. Both local prevention schemes operated according to their own coherent ideological framework, molded by structural circumstances. Given the contextual contingency of how agency is acquired and construed, a BCC intervention may undermine overall efficiency and the host community's cultural autonomy. Ethnographic analysis is needed to enhance our understanding of local schemes and their merits, and to envision more hybrid notions of agency mediating the global and local.},

  abstract = {The topic of this book is homogenization theory and its applications to optimal design in the conductivity and elasticity settings. Its purpose is to give a self-contained account of homogenization theory and explain how it applies to solving optimal design problems, from both a theoretical and a numerical point of view. The application of greatest practical interest tar­ geted by this book is shape and topology optimization in structural design, where this approach is known as the homogenization method. Shape optimization amounts to finding the optimal shape of a domain that, for example, would be of maximal conductivity or rigidity under some specified loading conditions (possibly with a volume or weight constraint). Such a criterion is embodied by an objective function and is computed through the solution of astate equation that is a partial differential equa­ tion (modeling the conductivity or the elasticity of the structure). Apart from those areas where the loads are applied, the shape boundary is al­ ways assumed to support Neumann boundary conditions (i. e. , isolating or traction-free conditions). In such a setting, shape optimization has a long history and has been studied by many different methods. There is, therefore, a vast literat ure in this field, and we refer the reader to the following short list of books, and references therein [39], [42], [130], [135], [149], [203], [220], [225], [237], [245], [258].},

Children of Mexican-origin farmworkers in the San Joaquin Valley have exceptionally high rates of asthma compared with children of Mexican descent in both the United States and Mexico. We suggest that public health paradigms, which posit that Mexican-American children are at relatively low risk of developing childhood asthma, do not apply to the population of children of Mexican immigrant farmworkers in the San Joaquin Valley. Combining ethnographic and photovoice methods, we demonstrate how industrial farming conditions systematically expose children of farmworkers to environmental insults over which they have little or no control, including pesticide exposure, bovine contamination, agricultural field burning, and substandard housing, all of which contribute to high prevalence of asthma among children. We argue that the application of structural vulnerability, structural violence, and ecosyndemic frameworks can be used to better explicate complex environmental injustices that might otherwise be overlooked by more reductionistic theories.},

  abstract = {Differentiable simulation is a promising toolkit for fast gradient-based policy optimization and system identification. However, existing approaches to differentiable simulation have largely tackled scenarios where obtaining smooth gradients has been relatively easy, such as systems with mostly smooth dynamics. In this work, we study the challenges that differentiable simulation presents when it is not feasible to expect that a single descent reaches a global optimum, which is often a problem in contact-rich scenarios. We analyze the optimization landscapes of diverse scenarios that contain both rigid bodies and deformable objects. In dynamic environments with highly deformable objects and fluids, differentiable simulators produce rugged landscapes with nonetheless useful gradients in some parts of the space. We propose a method that combines Bayesian optimization with semi-local 'leaps' to obtain a global search method that can use gradients effectively, while also maintaining robust performance in regions with noisy gradients. We show that our approach outperforms several gradient-based and gradient-free baselines on an extensive set of experiments in simulation, and also validate the method using experiments with a real robot and deformables.

  abstract = {This book provides theories on non-parametric shape optimization problems, systematically keeping in mind readers with an engineering background. Non-parametric shape optimization problems are defined as problems of finding the shapes of domains in which boundary value problems of partial differential equations are defined. In these problems, optimum shapes are obtained from an arbitrary form without any geometrical parameters previously assigned. In particular, problems in which the optimum shape is sought by making a hole in domain are called topology optimization problems. Moreover, a problem in which the optimum shape is obtained based on domain variation is referred to as a shape optimization problem of domain variation type, or a shape optimization problem in a limited sense. Software has been developed to solve these problems, and it is being used to seek practical optimum shapes. However, there are no books explaining such theories beginning with their foundations. The structure of the book is shown in the Preface. The theorems are built up using mathematical results. Therefore, a mathematical style is introduced, consisting of definitions and theorems to summarize the key points. This method of expression is advanced as provable facts are clearly shown. If something to be investigated is contained in the framework of mathematics, setting up a theory using theorems prepared by great mathematicians is thought to be an extremely effective approach. However, mathematics attempts to heighten the level of abstraction in order to understand many things in a unified fashion. This characteristic may baffle readers with an engineering background. Hence in this book, an attempt has been made to provide explanations in engineering terms, with examples from mechanics, after accurately denoting the provable facts using definitions and theorems.},

  abstract = {Control and manipulation of objects with underactuated dynamics remains a challenge for robots. Due to their typically nonlinear dynamics, it is computationally taxing to implement model-based planning and control techniques. Yet humans can skillfully manipulate such objects, seemingly with ease. More insight into human control strategies may inform how to enhance control strategies in robots. This study examined human control of objects that exhibit complex - underactuated and nonlinear - dynamics. We hypothesized that humans seek to make their trajectories exponentially stable to achieve robustness in the face of external perturbations. A stable trajectory is also robust to the high levels of noise in the human neuromotor system. Motivated by the task of carrying a cup of coffee, a virtual implementation of transporting a cart-pendulum system was developed. Subjects interacted with the virtual system via a robotic manipulandum that provided a haptic and visual interface. Human subjects were instructed to transport this simplified system to a target position as fast as possible without ‘spilling coffee’, while accommodating different visible perturbations that could be anticipated. To test the hypothesis of exponential convergence, tools from the framework of control contraction metrics were leveraged to analyze human trajectories. Results showed that with practice the trajectories indeed became exponentially stable, selectively around the perturbation. While these findings are agnostic about the involvement of feedback and feedforward control, they do support the hypothesis that humans learn to make trajectories stable, consistent with achieving predictability.},

  abstract = {Finding paths in high-dimensional spaces becomes difficult when we wish to optimize the cost of a path in addition to obeying feasibility constraints. Recently the T-RRT algorithm was presented as a method to plan in high-dimensional cost spaces and it was shown to perform well across a variety of problems. However, since the T-RRT relies solely on sampling to explore the space, it has difficulty navigating cost-space chasms narrow low-cost regions surrounded by increasing cost. Such chasms are particularly common in planning for manipulators because many useful cost functions induce narrow or lower dimensional low-cost areas. This paper presents the GradienT-RRT algorithm, which combines the T-RRT with a local gradient method to bias the search toward lower-cost regions. GradienT-RRT is effective at navigating chasms because it explores low-cost regions that are too narrow to explore by sampling alone. We compare the performance of T-RRT and GradienT-RRT on planning problems involving cost functions defined in workspace, task space, and C-space. We find that GradienT-RRT outperforms T-RRT in terms of the cost of the final path while maintaining better or comparable computation time. We also find that the cost of paths generated by GradienT-RRT is far less sensitive to changes in a key parameter, making it easier to tune the algorithm. Finally, we conclude with a demonstration of GradienT-RRT on a planning-with-uncertainty task on the physical HFRB robot.},

  abstract = {Every planning problem in robotics involves constraints. Whether the robot must avoid collision or joint limits, there are always states that are not permissible. Some constraints are straightforward to satisfy while others can be so stringent that feasible states are very difficult to find. What makes planning with constraints challenging is that, for many constraints, it is impossible or impractical to provide the planning algorithm with the allowed states explicitly; it must discover these states as it plans. The goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for representing and exploring feasible states in the context of manipulation planning. Planning for manipulation gives rise to a rich variety of tasks that include constraints on collision-avoidance, torque, balance, closed-chain kinematics, and end-effector pose. While many researchers have developed representations and strategies to plan with a specific constraint, the goal of this thesis is to develop a broad representation of constraints on a robot's configuration and identify general strategies to manage these constraints during the planning process. Some of the most important constraints in manipulation planning are functions of the pose of the manipulator's end-effector, so we devote a large part of this thesis to end-effector placement for grasping and transport tasks. We present an efficient approach to generating paths that uses Task Space Regions (TSRs) to specify manipulation tasks which involve end-effector pose goals and/or path constraints. We show how to use TSRs for path planning using the Constrained BiDirectional RRT (CBiRRT2) algorithm and describe several extensions of the TSR representation. Among them are methods to plan with object pose uncertainty, find optimal base placements, and handle more complex pose constraints by chaining TSRs together. We also explore the problem of automatically generating end-effector pose constraints for grasping tasks and present two grasp synthesis algorithms that can generate lists of grasps in extremely cluttered environments. We then describe how to convert these lists of grasps to TSRs so they can be used with CBiRRT2. We have applied our framework to a wide range of problems for several robots, both in simulation and in the real world. These problems include grasping in cluttered environments, lifting heavy objects, two-armed manipulation, and opening doors, to name a few. These example problems demonstrate our framework's practicality, and our proof of probabilistic completeness gives our approach a theoretical foundation. In addition to the above framework, we have also developed the Constellation algorithm for finding configurations that satisfy multiple stringent constraints where other constraint-satisfaction strategies fail. We also present the GradienT-RRT algorithm for planning with soft constraints, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approach to high-dimensional path planning with costs.},

  abstract = {Stable concurrent learning and control of dynamical systems is the subject of adaptive control. Despite being an established field with many practical applications and a rich theory, much of the development in adaptive control for nonlinear systems revolves around a few key algorithms. By exploiting strong connections between classical adaptive nonlinear control techniques and recent progress in optimization and machine learning, we show that there exists considerable untapped potential in algorithm development for both adaptive nonlinear control and adaptive dynamics prediction. We begin by introducing first-order adaptation laws inspired by natural gradient descent and mirror descent. We prove that when there are multiple dynamics consistent with the data, these non-Euclidean adaptation laws implicitly regularize the learned model. Local geometry imposed during learning thus may be used to select parameter vectors—out of the many that will achieve perfect tracking or prediction—for desired properties such as sparsity. We apply this result to regularized dynamics predictor and observer design, and as concrete examples, we consider Hamiltonian systems, Lagrangian systems, and recurrent neural networks. We subsequently develop a variational formalism based on the Bregman Lagrangian. We show that its Euler Lagrange equations lead to natural gradient and mirror descent-like adaptation laws with momentum, and we recover their first-order analogues in the infinite friction limit. We illustrate our analyses with simulations demonstrating our theoretical results.},

New developments in the understanding of the underlying physiology and pharmacologic treatment of pediatric asthma have occurred in recent years. Although inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists remain the initial treatment of choice for acute bronchospasm in asthma, there is increased understanding of the importance of inflammation in the disease process. There is also recognition of the role of cholinergic-mediated airway obstruction.

  abstract = {Modeling clay is a soft malleable material made from oils and waxes. This material is fundamental for ballistic evaluation of body armors because it is used as backing material in ballistic tests. After a ballistic impact, a back-face indentation is measured to assess performance of the armor. Due to the important role of modeling clay in this particular application, its mechanical characterization and comprehension of penetration mechanics are essential for development of new personal protection systems. This paper presents a two-step computational methodology to calibrate parameters of a Cowper–Symonds material model for modeling clay at characteristic strain rates up to 1.8×104 s−1. In the first stage, a high-speed camera is used to record the penetration of a gas-gun launched cylindrical mass with a hemispherical cap into a block of clay. Image-processing software is used to capture the tail of the projectile as it penetrates into the clay. These data are then used to sample the penetration depth as function of time. In the second stage, an in-house developed model of penetration, based on both the spherical cavity expansion theory and the Tate penetration equation, is used to determine, by inverse analysis, the parameters of the Cowper–Symonds clay model. The proposed constitutive relationship for clay and the determined material parameters can be applied accurately to problems involving high strain rates.},

Currently the Movement places its main emphasis on scaling up mental health services and advocating for the rights of the mentally ill, framed within universalised western understandings of health, healing and personhood. The papers in this section emphasise the need for greater attention to the impacts of context, culture and local survival strategies on peoples’ responses to adversity and illness, greater acknowledgement of the agency and resilience of vulnerable communities and increased attention to the way in which power inequalities and social injustices frame peoples’ opportunities for mental health. In this Introduction, we highlight ways in which greater community involvement opens up possibilities for tackling each of these challenges. Drawing on community health psychology, we outline our conceptualisation of “community mental health competence” defined as the ability of community members to work collectively to facilitate more effective prevention, care, treatment and advocacy. We highlight the roles of multi-level dialogue, critical thinking and partnerships in facilitating both the “voice” of vulnerable communities as well as “receptive social environments” where powerful groups are willing to recognise communities’ needs and assist them in working for improved well-being. Respectful local-global alliances have a key role to play in this process. The integration of local community struggles for mental health into an energetic global activist Movement opens up exciting possibilities for translating the Movement’s calls for improved global mental health from rhetoric to reality. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Moreover, this enables us not only to model point contact, but also to incorporate sophisticated models of compliant contact patches. Our time stepping scheme includes the midpoint rule, which we demonstrate achieves second order accuracy even with frictional contact. We introduce a number of accuracy metrics and show our method outperforms existing commercial and open source alternatives without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate robust simulation of robotic manipulation tasks at interactive rates, with accurately resolved stiction and contact transitions, as required for meaningful sim-to-real transfer.

  abstract = {Asthma has become a leading cause of childhood disability and school absenteeism in the United States. While asthma is a manageable chronic disease, the cost of its management is on the rise, especially because asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits cost five times more than primary care visits. Nonetheless, the costs of asthma management can be significantly decreased using effective management strategies via social network analyses and finding ways to reduce the asthma triggers that may cause ED visits. In this study, a social network analysis model is developed, which evaluates the impact of asthma management interventions by the number of ED visits from asthmatic children. Simulation results show that the implementation of an early symptom identification strategy for asthmatic children and their parents decrease the average number of annual ED visits for an asthmatic crisis from 0.156 visits to 0.042 visits per 1000 patients diagnosed with asthma. In addition, the simulation results reveal that the implementation of an asthma awareness programme in schools targeting teachers and staff members reduces the annual ED visits for asthmatic crises (per 1000 patients diagnosed with the disorder) to 0.108 visits per year. Asthma awareness campaign in school children would lead to a drop in the annual ED visits for an asthmatic crisis (per 1000 patients diagnosed with the disorder) to 0.103 visits per year. The use of a public asthma awareness campaign leads to a change in the annual ED visits for an asthmatic crisis (per 1000 patients diagnosed with the disorder) from 0.156 visits to 0.144 visits per year.},

We present a method for continuous improvement of modeling and control after deploying the robot to a dynamically-changing target environment. We develop a differentiable physics simulation framework that performs online system identification and optimal control simultaneously, using the incoming observations from the target environment in real time. To ensure robust system identification against noisy observations, we devise an algorithm to assess the confidence of our estimated parameters, using numerical analysis of the dynamic equations. To ensure real-time optimal control, we adaptively schedule the optimization window in the future so that the optimized actions can be replenished faster than they are consumed, while staying as up-to-date with new sensor information as possible. The constant re-planning based on a constantly improved model allows the robot to swiftly adapt to the changing environment and utilize real-world data in the most sample-efficient way. Thanks to a fast differentiable physics simulator, the optimization for both system identification and control can be solved efficiently for robots operating in real time. We demonstrate our method on a set of examples in simulation and show that our results are favorable compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot's visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 11 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9\%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models. Code, data, and training details will be publicly available.},

The marginalization of local knowledge systems, it is argued, was established in the colonial times that relegated all things indigenous or from the colonized communities as unworthy, uncivilized, barbaric and superstitious. Systematic efforts to inscribe Western ways of cultural, economic, political and social systems were applied during the colonial times and maintained in the post‐independence era. The educational system did not escape the colonial construction of the colonized subjects and their relegation to otherness. Years after the struggle for independence the content of what is taught, methods of teaching and research remain Western in non‐Western contexts. This does not only alienate the ‘othered’ from their own knowledge systems, it can be a matter of life and death as demonstrated by the HIV/AIDS information and education campaign. Using excerpts from studies on HIV/AIDS, the paper highlights that interventions to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, legitimized by conventional/Western research knowledge and frameworks, have alienated the people from the struggle to prevent the spread of the virus. Findings from a number of research studies on HIV/AIDS in Botswana are analyzed within the framework of current prevention strategies, more specifically posters and cartoons used in the campaign against HIV/AIDS, to illustrate the marginalization of other knowledge systems and the intersection of the ‘otherness’ ideology with mainstream First World research methodologies.},

Contemporary development programmes are anticipatory in nature: they are focused on managing health, behaviour, education and social relations today in ways that are believed to open opportunities for some distant and better future. Working with rural youth who “just stay,” an idiom youth use to describe their “failure” to make progress towards desired futures, I show how discourses and ideals espoused in anticipatory programmes including human rights, education, gender and love are slippery concepts. As they percolate through this particular social, political, historical and demographic context and into the imaginaries of young people, these discourses often become something new and unexpected. In particular I show how: i) a discursive elision occurs between the rights discourse and other markers of modernity and youth take up their “right” to wear modern clothing and drink commercial alcohol, ii) selfish behaviours including alcoholism and womanising surface in boys’ self-constructions as innate tendencies rather than part of a socially produced and constantly shifting construction of masculinity, iii) audit cultures, critical to the operation of anticipatory programmes, reduce gender equality to something “countable,” which, in turn, alters programme activities, leads to performances by participants and filters into youth subjectivities, and iv) discourses on modern and “healthy” loves, free from HIV/AIDS, lead to re-arrangements in romantic relations and friendships that provide new and positive opportunities for women not always available in customary marriages. By privileging the future over the present and the past, programmes overlook numerous structural barriers to improving the lives of the youth who “just stay.” I argue that the unanticipated effects of these programmes constitute and give rise to several invisible forms of violence. On the other hand, however, some effects are generative of new and positive subjectivities and relationships that are egregiously overlooked by programmes. This ignorance prevents programmes from building upon positive effects to generate desired change and sometimes even undermines their own stated goals.},

  abstract = {The objective of this book is to give a comprehensive presentation of mathematical constructions and tools that can be used to study problems where the modeling, optimization, or control variable is no longer a set of parameters or functions but the shape or the structure of a geometric object. In that context, a good analytical framework and good modeling techniques must be able to handle the occurrence of singular behaviors whenever they are compatible with the mechanics or the physics of the problems at hand. In some optimization problems, the natural intuitive notion of a geometric domain undergoes mutations into relaxed entities such as microstructures. So the objects under consideration need not be smooth open domains, or even sets, as long as they still makes sense mathematically. This book covers the basic mathematical ideas, constructions, and methods that come from different fields of mathematical activities and areas of applications that have often evolved in parallel directions. The scope of research is frighteningly broad because it touches on areas that include classical geometry, modern partial differential equations, geometric measure theory, topological groups, and constrained optimization, with applications to classical mechanics of continuous media such as fluid mechanics, elasticity theory, fracture theory, modern theories of optimal design, optimal location and shape of geometric objects, free and moving boundary problems, and image processing. Innovative modeling or new issues raised in some applications force a new look at the fundamentals of well-established mathematical areas such as geometry, to relax basic notions of volume, perimeter, and curvature or boundary value problems, and to find suitable relaxations of solutions. In that spirit, Henri Lebesgue was probably a pioneer when he relaxed the intuitive notion of volume to the one of measure on an equivalence class of measurable sets in 1907. He was followed in that endeavor in the early 1950s by the celebrated work of E. De Giorgi, who used the relaxed notion of perimeter defined on the class of Caccioppoli sets to solve Plateau’s problem of minimal surfaces. The material that is pertinent to the study of geometric objects and the entities and functions that are defined on them would necessitate an encyclopedic investment to bring together the basic theories and their fields of applications. This objective is obviously beyond the scope of a single book and two authors. The coverage of this book is more modest. Yet, it contains most of the important fundamentals at this stage of evolution of this expanding field. Even if shape analysis and optimization have undergone considerable and important developments on the theoretical and numerical fronts, there are still cultural barriers between areas of applications and between theories. The whole field is extremely active, and the best is yet to come with fundamental structures and tools beginning to emerge. It is hoped that this book will help to build new bridges and stimulate cross-fertilization of ideas and methods.},

  abstract = {Asthma is a globally significant non-communicable disease with major public health consequences for both children and adults, including high morbidity, and mortality in severe cases. We have summarized the evidence on asthma trends, environmental determinants, and long-term impacts while comparing these epidemiological features across childhood asthma and adult asthma. While asthma incidence and prevalence are higher in children, morbidity, and mortality are higher in adults. Childhood asthma is more common in boys while adult asthma is more common in women, and the reversal of this sex difference in prevalence occurs around puberty suggesting sex hormones may play a role in the etiology of asthma. The global epidemic of asthma that has been observed in both children and adults is still continuing, especially in low to middle income countries, although it has subsided in some developed countries. As a heterogeneous disease, distinct asthma phenotypes, and endotypes need to be adequately characterized to develop more accurate and meaningful definitions for use in research and clinical settings. This may be facilitated by new clustering techniques such as latent class analysis, and computational phenotyping methods are being developed to retrieve information from electronic health records using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to assist in the early diagnosis of asthma. While some important environmental determinants that trigger asthma are well-established, more work is needed to define the role of environmental exposures in the development of asthma in both children and adults. There is increasing evidence that investigation into possible gene-by-environment and environment-by-environment interactions may help to better uncover the determinants of asthma. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further investigate the interrelationship between environmental and genetic determinants to identify high risk groups and key modifiable exposures. For children, asthma may impair airway development and reduce maximally attained lung function, and these lung function deficits may persist into adulthood without additional progressive loss. Adult asthma may accelerate lung function decline and increase the risk of fixed airflow obstruction, with the effect of early onset asthma being greater than late onset asthma. Therefore, in managing asthma, our focus going forward should be firmly on improving not only short-term symptoms, but also the long-term respiratory and other health outcomes.},

The disease has a broad spectrum of potential determinants ranging from genetics to lifestyle and environmental factors. Epidemiological observations have demonstrated that several important lifestyle and environmental factors including obesity, urban living, dietary patterns such as food low in antioxidants and fast food, non-breastfeeding, gut flora imbalance, cigarette smoking, air pollution, and viral infection are associated with asthma exacerbations in children. However, only environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with the development of asthma. Despite epidemiological studies indicating that many other factors are probably associated with the development of asthma, the relationships are not considered causal due to the inadequate evidence and inconsistent results from recent studies. This may highlight that sufficient data and exact mechanisms of causality are still in need of further study.},

It potentially has high usage in many autonomous applications with robotic arms, where preservation or minimization of tool-point rotation is required. The original STOMP algorithm is unable to use the cartesian path constraints in a trajectory generation because it works only in robot joint space. Therefore, the designed solution, described in this paper, extends the most important parts of the algorithm to take into account cartesian constraints. The new sampling noise generator generates trajectory samples in cartesian space, while the new cost function evaluates them and minimizes traversed distance and rotation change of the tool-point in the resulting trajectory. These improvements are verified with simple experiments and the solution is compared with the original STOMP. Results of the experiments show that the implementation satisfies the cartesian constraints requirements.},

We develop an object-agnostic approach for estimation and control that circumvents this need. Our framework directly estimates a set of wrench and motion constraints which it uses to regulate the contact configuration. We use this to reactively manipulate unknown planar objects in the gravity plane. A video describing our work can be found on our project page: http://mcube.mit.edu/research/contactConfig.html.},

While intervention lags behind empirical knowledge, this trend enhances the controversy as to whether the unit of intervention in PV should be the male or the female, the individual or the couple. The first section of this paper provides a brief review of the development of our understanding of PV and the limited incorporation of new knowledge into core intervention goals with female and male clients. The second part of the paper illustrates how gender related controversies are reflected in the roles, self perceptions and functioning of therapists in the field. This section is based on qualitative data from a series of studies performed on therapists by the authors and their students during the last ten years. The transformative gender experience is examined, showing how the successful and open self-examination of gender related issues might lead to personal and professional growth. Research highlights ► PV is gradually seen as more interactive and mutual rather than unidirectional. ► PV intervention goals reveal a limited incorporation of new knowledge into practice. ► Traditional gender-based roles are often incorporated by clients and therapists. ► Therapists struggle with their professional selves over the gender controversy. ► Success in this struggle leads to a gender identity that embraces complexity.},

Its ability to cope with unstructured environments and accomplish hard-to-engineer behaviors has led reinforcement learning agents to be increasingly applied in real-life scenarios. However, there is still a long way ahead for reinforcement learning to become a core element in industrial applications. This paper examines the landscape of reinforcement learning and reviews advances in its application in contact-rich tasks from 2017 to the present. The analysis investigates the main research for the most commonly selected tasks for testing reinforcement learning algorithms in both rigid and deformable object manipulation. Additionally, the trends around reinforcement learning associated with serial manipulators are explored as well as the various technological challenges that this machine learning control technique currently presents. Lastly, based on the state-of-the-art and the commonalities among the studies, a framework relating the main concepts of reinforcement learning in contact-rich manipulation tasks is proposed. The final goal of this review is to support the robotics community in future development of systems commanded by reinforcement learning, discuss the main challenges of this technology and suggest future research directions in the domain.},

Paul Farmer, a physician and anthropologist with twenty years of experience working in Haiti, Peru, and Russia, argues that promoting the social and economic rights of the world's poor is the most important human rights struggle of our times. With passionate eyewitness accounts from the prisons of Russia and the beleaguered villages of Haiti and Chiapas, this book links the lived experiences of individual victims to a broader analysis of structural violence. Farmer challenges conventional thinking within human rights circles and exposes the relationships between political and economic injustice, on one hand, and the suffering and illness of the powerless, on the other. Farmer shows that the same social forces that give rise to epidemic diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis also sculpt risk for human rights violations. He illustrates the ways that racism and gender inequality in the United States are embodied as disease and death. Yet this book is far from a hopeless inventory of abuse. Farmer's disturbing examples are linked to a guarded optimism that new medical and social technologies will develop in tandem with a more informed sense of social justice. Otherwise, he concludes, we will be guilty of managing social inequality rather than addressing structural violence. Farmer's urgent plea to think about human rights in the context of global public health and to consider critical issues of quality and access for the world's poor should be of fundamental concern to a world characterized by the bizarre proximity of surfeit and suffering.},

Models of crowd behavior facilitate analysis and prediction of human group behavior, where people are close geographically or logically, and are affected by each other’s presence and actions. Existing models of crowd behavior, in a variety of fields, leave many open challenges. In particular, psychology models often offer only qualitative description, and do not easily permit algorithmic replication, while computer science models are often not tied to cognitive theory and often focus only on a specific phenomenon (e.g., flocking, bi-directional pedestrian movement), and thus must be switched depending on the goals of the simulation. We propose a novel model of crowd behavior, based on Festinger’s Social Comparison Theory (SCT), a social psychology theory known and expanded since the early 1950’s. We propose a concrete algorithmic framework for SCT, and evaluate its implementations in several pedestrian movement phenomena such as creation of lanes in bidirectional movement and movement in groups with and without obstacle. Compared to popular models from the literature, the SCT model was shown to provide improved results. We also evaluate the SCT model on general pedestrian movement, and validate the model against human pedestrian behavior. The results show that SCT generates behavior more in-tune with human crowd behavior then existing non-cognitive models.},

Optimal RRTs (RRT*s) extend RRTs to the problem of finding the optimal solution, but in doing so asymptotically find the optimal path from the initial state to every state in the planning domain. This behaviour is not only inefficient but also inconsistent with their single-query nature. For problems seeking to minimize path length, the subset of states that can improve a solution can be described by a prolate hyperspheroid. We show that unless this subset is sampled directly, the probability of improving a solution becomes arbitrarily small in large worlds or high state dimensions. In this paper, we present an exact method to focus the search by directly sampling this subset.},

  abstract = {This article explores the nature and function of intersubjectivity in religious education (RE) praxis. It is very common for religious educators to prioritise forms of RE that emphasise the importance of intersubjective, dialogical praxis. It is much less common, however, that theorists devote sustained time to thick description of the practice–what exactly it is, who is involved and what its practical and empirical benefits are. This article proposes that intersubjective dialogical praxis can flourish when a "safe space" is created for students, particularly with regard to teacher-student dialogue. The first half of the article is theoretical, while the second half uses empirical evidence from participatory action research to demonstrate how intersubjective place sharing and meaning-making occurred in several Episcopal Church affiliated United States high schools. The article concludes that teacher relationality is a central though under-appreciated dimension of sound RE praxis that aims towards good citizenship and a student's personal and spiritual development.},

Contraction analysis was originally considered for ordinary differential equations, but has been extended to discrete-time systems, control systems, delay equations and many other types of systems. Moreover, similar techniques can be applied for the estimation of the dimension of attractors and for the estimation of different notions of entropy (including topological entropy). This review attempts to link the references in both the mathematical and the engineering literature and, furthermore, point out the recent developments and algorithms in the computation of contraction metrics.}

A review of the literature defines EI, constructivism, and chaos theory, as well as exploring elements of a safe learning environment. The literature is considered along with data gathered from a recent study of twenty-one EI trainers in New Zealand, in an effort to identify key characteristics of a safe learning environment, and positive and negative qualities of the trainer and learners which can contribute to creating a safe learning environment. Based on these findings the Emotional Intelligence Learning Environment Model was developed. The article discusses the implications of the model and concludes with suggestions for future research.},

We examine how multiple measures of both biological (family history of asthma) and social risk factors (home environment quality, socioeconomic status, and demographic characteristics) influence asthma risk among U.S. adults. Method. Using logistic regression models, we analyze data from a sample of 6,337 adults from the 2003-2004 National Asthma Survey. Results. Prevalence rates of current asthma are four times higher among adults with a family history of asthma, and the odds of having asthma are influenced most strongly by having asthmatic parents or grandparents (and, to a lesser extent, asthmatic siblings). We also find that social factors, especially characteristics of the home environment, significantly increase the odds of suffering from asthma as an adult. Conclusion. Our results show that all measures of family history are strongly linked to adult asthma prevalence, even when social factors are controlled. Social factors are also important, but very little of this is as a mediating influence that links family history and adult asthma; rather, family and social conditions have mostly independent effects.},

The idea that outdoor air pollution can cause exacerbations of pre-existing asthma is supported by an evidence base that has been accumulating for several decades, with several studies suggesting a contribution to new-onset asthma as well. In this Series paper, we discuss the effects of particulate matter (PM), gaseous pollutants (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide), and mixed traffic-related air pollution. We focus on clinical studies, both epidemiological and experimental, published in the previous 5 years. From a mechanistic perspective, air pollutants probably cause oxidative injury to the airways, leading to inflammation, remodelling, and increased risk of sensitisation. Although several pollutants have been linked to new-onset asthma, the strength of the evidence is variable. We also discuss clinical implications, policy issues, and research gaps relevant to air pollution and asthma.},

Of the 721 parent–adolescent dyads recruited for the study, 167 videotapes of sexual discussions between parents and adolescent were coded for the family-based intervention and 191 videotapes for the active comparison. Longitudinal analyses examined differences between conditions (family-based vs. comparison) in self-reported and observed parent–adolescent sexual discussions and also examined the impact of gender on intervention response. More parent I-statements, healthier parent body language, and fewer adolescent Negative Vocalizations were detected for family-based intervention participants 12 months after participating in the brief intervention (11 h of total intervention time) relative to those in the comparison condition. Parents in the family-based intervention also self-reported better sexual communication at 12 months. The current study provides supporting evidence that a relatively brief family-based intervention was successful at addressing parent–adolescent sexual communication among a mental health sample.},

We prove that the feedback controller at the vicinity of the linearization is guaranteed to drive the nonlinear system to the target region. During online execution, we solve linear programs to track the system trajectory.

We investigated whether exacerbation of symptoms is associated with farming exposures among agricultural pesticide applicators with asthma. Methods Participants were pesticide applicators with active asthma (wheezing and breathing problems in past 12 months) who completed enrollment questionnaires for the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). Exacerbation of asthma was defined as having visited a hospital emergency room or doctor for an episode of wheezing or whistling in the past 12 months. Exposures of interest were using 36 specific pesticides in the past 12 months and conducting various agricultural activities. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by logistic regression while controlling for potential confounders. Results The 926 AHS adult pesticide applicators with active asthma included 202 (22 \%) with exacerbation. Inverse associations with exacerbation were observed for two herbicides [glyphosate, odds ratio (OR) = 0.5, 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.3, 0.8, and paraquat, OR = 0.3, 95 \% CI 0.1, 0.9] and several agricultural activities (repairing engines, grinding metal, driving diesel tractors, and performing veterinary procedures). Only asthma cases with allergies (i.e., doctor-diagnosed hay fever or eczema, 46 \%) had positive exacerbation–pesticide associations, with OR = 2.1 (95 \% CI 1.1, 4.1) for the herbicide pendimethalin and OR = 10.2 (95 \% CI 1.9, 55) for the insecticide aldicarb. Conclusions The inverse associations with two pesticides and specific farm activities are consistent with the possibility that asthma cases prone to exacerbation may avoid exposures that trigger symptoms. Although limited by small sample size and a cross-sectional design, our study suggests that use of specific pesticides may contribute to exacerbation of asthma among individuals with allergies.},

This article reviews the mechanistic evidence lending support to the concept that either acute or chronic low-level inhalation of pesticides may trigger asthma attacks, exacerbate asthma or increase the risk of developing asthma. RECENT FINDINGSPesticide aerosols or gases, like other respiratory irritants, can lead to asthma through interaction with functional irritant receptors in the airway and promoting neurogenic inflammation. Cross-talk between airway nerves and inflammatory cells helps to maintain chronic inflammation that eventually damages the bronchial epithelium. Certain organophosphorus insecticides cause airway hyper-reactivity via a common mechanism of disrupting negative feedback control of cholinergic regulation in the lungs. These pesticides may interact synergistically with allergen sensitization rendering individuals more susceptible for developing asthma. SUMMARYMany pesticides are sensitizers or irritants capable of directly damaging the bronchial mucosa, thus making the airway very sensitive to allergens or other stimuli. However, most pesticides are weakly immunogenic so that their potential to sensitize airways in exposed populations is limited. Pesticides may increase the risk of developing asthma, exacerbate a previous asthmatic condition or even trigger asthma attacks by increasing bronchial hyper-responsiveness.},

However, information about the relationship between viral infections and atopy among children whose attacks of wheezing lead to hospitalization is unclear. To evaluate the prevalence of viral respiratory tract pathogens among infants and children hospitalized for wheezing and to analyze the results in relation to the patient's age, atopic characteristics, and season of admission. This was a case-control study of children (age 2 months to 18 years) admitted for wheezing to the University of Virginia Medical Center over a period of 12 months. Children without wheezing were enrolled as controls. Nasal secretions were evaluated for viral pathogens by using cultures, PCR tests, and antigen detection. Total IgE and specific IgE antibody to common aeroallergens was measured in serum. Seventy percent of children hospitalized for wheezing before age 3 years (n = 79) were admitted between December and March, whereas 46\% of children age 3 to 18 years (n = 54) were hospitalized between September and November. Among children younger than 3 years, viral pathogens were detected in 84\% (66/79) of wheezing children and 55\% (42/77) of controls ( P {$<$} .001). Respiratory syncytial virus was the dominant pathogen during the winter months, but rhinovirus was more common during other months. Total serum IgE levels were generally low, and values from wheezing and control subjects overlapped considerably. Among children 3 years and older, 61\% (33/54) of subjects admitted for wheezing tested positive for virus (predominantly rhinovirus), compared with 21\% (12/56) of controls ( P {$<$} .001). The total serum IgE values among wheezing children (geometric mean, 386 IU/mL; 95\% CI, 259-573) were substantially elevated compared with those of controls (geometric mean, 38 IU/mL; 95\% CI, 26-56; P {$<$} .001). A significantly higher percentage of wheezing children compared with controls was sensitized to at least 1 of the inhaled allergens tested: 84\% (36/43) compared with 33\% (15/45; P {$<$} .001). The atopic characteristics of wheezing children who tested positive or negative for virus were similar. Viral infections were the dominant risk factor for wheezing among children hospitalized before 3 years of age. By comparison, a large majority of the wheezing children age 3 to 18 years had striking atopic characteristics that may be critical as a risk factor for hospitalization and an adverse response to viral infections, especially infections caused by rhinovirus.},

Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN.

  abstract = {This paper investigates real-time control strategies for dynamical systems that involve frictional contact interactions. Hybridness and underactuation are key characteristics of these systems that complicate the design of feedback controllers. In this research, we examine and test a novel feedback controller design on a planar pushing system, where the purpose is to control the motion of a sliding object on a flat surface using a point robotic pusher. The pusher-slider is a simple dynamical system that retains many of the challenges that are typical of robotic manipulation tasks. Our results show that a model predictive control approach used in tandem with integer programming offers a powerful solution to capture the dynamic constraints associated with the friction cone as well as the hybrid nature of the contact. In order to achieve real-time control, simplifications are proposed to speed up the integer program. The concept of Family of Modes (FOM) is introduced to solve an online convex optimization problem by selecting a set of contact mode schedules that spans a large set of dynamic behaviors that can occur during the prediction horizon. The controller design is applied to stabilize the motion of a sliding object about a nominal trajectory, and to re-plan its trajectory in real-time to follow a moving target. We validate the controller design through numerical simulations and experimental results on an industrial ABB IRB 120 robotic arm.},

The author argues that one source of these reactions is people's taken-for-granted beliefs about gender, which limit their ability to understand the research on women's resistance and self-defense—and, indeed, prevent them from being able to conceptualize women as strong and competent social actors. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Simulated virtual environments serve as one of the main driving forces behind developing and evaluating skill learning algorithms. However, existing environments typically only simulate rigid body physics. Additionally, the simulation process usually does not provide gradients that might be useful for planning and control optimizations. We introduce a new differentiable physics benchmark called PasticineLab, which includes a diverse collection of soft body manipulation tasks. In each task, the agent uses manipulators to deform the plasticine into the desired configuration. The underlying physics engine supports differentiable elastic and plastic deformation using the DiffTaichi system, posing many under-explored challenges to robotic agents. We evaluate several existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods and gradient-based methods on this benchmark. Experimental results suggest that 1) RL-based approaches struggle to solve most of the tasks efficiently; 2) gradient-based approaches, by optimizing open-loop control sequences with the built-in differentiable physics engine, can rapidly find a solution within tens of iterations, but still fall short on multi-stage tasks that require long-term planning. We expect that PlasticineLab will encourage the development of novel algorithms that combine differentiable physics and RL for more complex physics-based skill learning tasks.},

The obstacle avoidance problem is inverted to enforce that the flow remains enclosed within a volume defined by a polygonal surface. We formally guarantee that such a flow will never contact the boundaries of the enclosing volume or obstacles. It asymptotically converges toward an attractor. We further create smooth motion fields around obstacles with edges (e.g., tables). Both obstacles and enclosures may be time-varying, i.e., moving, expanding, and shrinking. The technique enables a robot to navigate within enclosed corridors while avoiding static and moving obstacles. It was applied on an autonomous robot (QOLO) in a static complex indoor environment and tested in simulations with dense crowds. The final proof of concept was performed in an outdoor environment in Lausanne. The QOLO-robot successfully traversed a marketplace in the center of town in the presence of a diverse crowd with a nonuniform motion pattern.},

For robots to do the same, it is crucial that they are endowed with highly reactive obstacle avoidance which is adept at partial and poor sensing. We address the issue of enabling obstacle avoidance based on sparse and asynchronous perception. The proposed control scheme combines a high-level input command provided by either a planner or a human operator with fast reactive obstacle avoidance (FOA). The sampling-based sensor data can be combined with an analytical reconstruction of the obstacles for real-time collision avoidance. Thus, we can ensure that the agent does not become stuck when a feasible path exists between obstacles. Our algorithm was evaluated experimentally on static laser data from cluttered, indoor office environments. Additionally, it was used in shared-control mode in a dynamic and complex outdoor environment in the center of Lausanne. The proposed control scheme successfully avoided collisions in both scenarios. During the experiments, the controller took 1 ms to evaluate over 30000 data points.},

Similar to how we give instructions to each other (go straight, and then after multiple meters move left, and then a sharp turn right.), we give the instructions to a robot as a relative rotation. We first introduce an obstacle avoidance framework that allows avoiding star-shaped obstacles while trying to stay close to an initial (linear or nonlinear) dynamical system. The framework of the local rotation is extended to motion learning. Automated clustering defines regions of local stability, for which the precise dynamics are individually learned.

We also develop a Compatible Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) algorithm on top of MLS-MPM. Utilizing a colored distance field representation and a novel compatibility condition for particles and grid nodes, our framework enables the simulation of various new phenomena that are not previously supported by MPM, including material cutting, dynamic open boundaries, and two-way coupling with rigid bodies.

  abstract = {This dissertation offers a sociocultural linguistic perspective on the politics of knowledge in development work in an economically challenged post-colonial context by exploring discourses emerging in semi-formal education about reproductive health in rural Tanzania. The questions about knowledge value in such contexts have been mainly addressed from the macro-perspective of state policies, globalization, and debates on neo- and post-colonialism. From this perspective, knowledge, or rather global and local knowledges, are treated as given entities in an ongoing struggle with one another. Applying a micro-perspective of research on talk-in-interaction, this dissertation suggests that knowledge, its forms and values, are instead situated in a dynamic, mutually constituting relationship. This project adds to the growing body of literature on knowledge appropriation and offers an insight into the ongoing creation of a “third space” (Bhabha, 1994; Higgins, 2011; Kramsch, 1993) or a “third culture” (Useem \& Useem, 1967) in the intersection of traditional ideologies about language, sex, and gender and the “enlightenment discourse” (Higgins, 2010b, p. 70) of Western biomedical rationalism. Building on the idea that language is an essential component of knowledge and that talk is a form of social action, this dissertation explores linguistic choices and discursive norms as a medium and an outcome of knowledge appropriation. By scrutinizing language use in two main contexts of development work, namely training sessions for future educators and teaching sessions conducted by the educators for the target population provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), this dissertation addresses the following questions: 1) how epistemic status and authority is co-constructed in interaction; 2) how the shared understanding of knowledge needs is created; and 3) how the knowledge needs are addressed. This research finds that NGOs create a novel site for socialization into sexuality and gender by licensing for transgressing discursive prohibitions, which, however, may or may not translate in changing sexual behaviors or ideologies about sexuality and gender. Instead, the acquisition of a development register becomes a significant learning outcome. Students and educators are socialized into recognizing a particular vocabulary, interactional practices, and language ideologies as a valuable asset and a commodity.},

In this paper, we consider what it would look like to fold as much of the trajectory optimization pipeline as possible into the modeling problem, such that sampling from the model and planning with it become nearly identical. The core of our technical approach lies in a diffusion probabilistic model that plans by iteratively denoising trajectories. We show how classifier-guided sampling and image inpainting can be reinterpreted as coherent planning strategies, explore the unusual and useful properties of diffusion-based planning methods, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in control settings that emphasize long-horizon decision-making and test-time flexibility.},

  abstract = {Background Multi-component interventions combining educational and environmental strategies have proved effective in increasing children and adolescents' fruit and vegetable intake. However such interventions are complex and difficult to implement and several studies report poor implementation. There is a need for knowledge on the role of dose for behaviour change and for assessment of intervention dose to avoid conclusions that intervention components which are not implemented are ineffective. This study aimed to examine 1) the association between dose of a class curriculum and adolescents' fruit and vegetable intake in a school-based multi-component intervention, 2) if gender and socioeconomic position modify this association. Methods We carried out secondary analysis of data from intervention schools in the cluster-randomized Boost study targeting 13-year-olds' fruit and vegetable intake. Teacher- and student data on curriculum dose delivered and received were aggregated to the school-level and class-level (only possible for student data). We analysed the association between curriculum dose and students' (n 995) self-reported fruit and vegetable intake (24-h recall questionnaire) after finalization of the intervention using multi-level analyses. Potential moderation was examined by analyses stratified by gender and socioeconomic position. Results Average dose received at class-level was significantly associated with students' fruit and vegetable intake (10 g (CI: 0.06, 20.33) per curricular activity received). In stratified analyses the association remained significant among boys only (14 g (CI: 2.84, 26.76) per curricular activity received). The average dose delivered and received at the school-level was not significantly associated with students' intake. Conclusions We found a dose–response relationship between number of curricular activities received and adolescents' fruit and vegetable intake. The results indicate that curriculum dose received only mattered for promotion of fruit and vegetable intake among boys. Future studies should explore this gender difference in larger samples to guide the planning of school-based curricular interventions with regards to the optimal number of curricular activities required to promote behavioural change in subgroups with low fruit and vegetable intake at baseline.

Although individual men's use of violence differs, engagement of all men and boys in action to prevent violence against women and girls is essential. We discuss why this engagement approach is theoretically important and how prevention interventions have developed from treating men simply as perpetrators of violence against women and girls or as allies of women in its prevention, to approaches that seek to transform the relations, social norms, and systems that sustain gender inequality and violence. We review evidence of intervention effectiveness in the reduction of violence or its risk factors, features commonly seen in more effective interventions, and how strong evidence-based interventions can be developed with more robust use of theory. Future interventions should emphasise work with both men and boys and women and girls to change social norms on gender relations, and need to appropriately accommodate the differences between men and women in the design of programmes.},

Subjects: 108 Children aged 9-11 years who had reported wheeze or cough, or both, in a questionnaire. Setting: Southampton and surrounding community. Main outcome measures: Upper and lower respiratory viral infections detected by polymerase chain reaction or conventional methods, reported exacerbations of asthma, computer identified episodes of respiratory tract symptoms or peak flow reductions. Results: Viruses were detected in 80\% of reported episodes of reduced peak expiratory flow, 80\% of reported episodes of wheeze, and in 85\% of reported episodes of upper respiratory symptoms, cough, wheeze, and a fall in peak expiratory flow. The median duration of reported falls in peak expiratory flow was 14 days, and the median maximum fall in peak expiratory flow was 81 1/min. The most commonly identified virus type was rhinovirus. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis that upper respiratory viral infections are associated with 80-85\% of asthma exacerbations in school age children. Key messages Key messages In this study common cold viruses were found in 80-85\% of reported exacerbations of asthma in children Rhinoviruses, which cause most common colds, accounted for two thirds of viruses detected Analysis of diary cards also showed large numbers of similar but less severe episodes that may also be viral in origin},

The approach relies on generating noisy trajectories to explore the space around an initial (possibly infeasible) trajectory, which are then combined to produced an updated trajectory with lower cost. A cost function based on a combination of obstacle and smoothness cost is optimized in each iteration. No gradient information is required for the particular optimization algorithm that we use and so general costs for which derivatives may not be available (e.g. costs corresponding to constraints and motor torques) can be included in the cost function. We demonstrate the approach both in simulation and on a mobile manipulation system for unconstrained and constrained tasks. We experimentally show that the stochastic nature of STOMP allows it to overcome local minima that gradient-based methods like CHOMP can get stuck in.},

They support analysis, facilitate qualitative and quantitative predictions, and synthesize behaviors for simulations. One promising approach to crowd modeling relies on micro-level agent-based simulations, where the interactions of simulated individual agents in the crowd result in macro-level crowd dynamics which are the object of study. This article reports on an agent-based model of urban pedestrian crowds, where culture is explicitly modeled . We extend an established agent-based social agent model, inspired by social psychology, to account for individual cultural attributes discussed in social science literature. We then embed the model in a simulation of pedestrians and explore the resulting macro-level crowd behaviors, such as pedestrian flow, lane changes rate, and so on. We validate the model by quantitatively comparing the simulation results to the pedestrian dynamics in movies of human crowds in five different countries: Iraq, Israel, England, Canada, and France. We conclude that the model can faithfully replicate urban pedestrians in different cultures. Encouraged by these results, we explore simulations of mixed-culture pedestrian crowds.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM∗ and RRT∗, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

This paper proposes a versatile local planning and control framework for contact-rich manipulation that determines the continuous control action under variable contact modes online. We model the physical characteristics of contact-rich manipulation by quasistatic dynamics and complementarity constraints. We then propose a linear complementarity quadratic program (LCQP) to efficiently determine the control action that implicitly includes the decisions on the contact modes under these constraints. In the LCQP, we relax the complementarity constraints to alleviate ill-conditioned problems that are typically caused by measure noises or model miss-matches. We conduct dynamical simulations on a 3D physical simulator and demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve various contact-rich manipulation tasks by determining the control action including the contact modes in real-time.},

Each latent vector is learned to decode to the 3D shape of an object and the 3D shape of a robotic hand in a grasping pose in terms of the signed distance functions of the two 3D shapes. In addition, the distance metric in the latent space is learned to preserve the similarity between grasps across different robotic hands, where the similarity of grasps is defined according to contact regions of the robotic hands. This property enables our method to transfer grasps between different grippers including a human hand, and grasp transfer has the potential to share grasping skills between robots and enable robots to learn grasping skills from humans. Furthermore, the encoded signed distance functions of objects and grasps in our implicit representation can be used for 6D object pose estimation with grasping contact optimization from partial point clouds, which enables robotic grasping in the real world.},

Now, two fundamental things have changed that may forever affect our understanding of modern epidemiology: the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the age of machine learning. Here, to embrace this opportunity, we introduce the concept of mathematical epidemiology in light of data-driven modeling and physics-based learning.

  abstract = {Abstract: Global health financing has increased dramatically in recent years, indicative of a rise in health as a foreign policy issue. Several governments have issued specific foreign policy statements on global health and a new term, global health diplomacy, has been coined to describe the processes by which state and non-state actors engage to position health issues more prominently in foreign policy decision-making. Their ability to do so is important to advancing international cooperation in health. In this paper we review the arguments for health in foreign policy that inform global health diplomacy. These are organized into six policy frames: security, development, global public goods, trade, human rights and ethical/moral reasoning. Each of these frames has implications for how global health as a foreign policy issue is conceptualized. Differing arguments within and between these policy frames, while overlapping, can also be contradictory. This raises an important question about which arguments prevail in actual state decision-making. This question is addressed through an analysis of policy or policy-related documents and academic literature pertinent to each policy framing with some assessment of policy practice. The reference point for this analysis is the explicit goal of improving global health equity. This goal has increasing national traction within national public health discourse and decision-making and, through the Millennium Development Goals and other multilateral reports and declarations, is entering global health policy discussion. Initial findings support conventional international relations theory that most states, even when committed to health as a foreign policy goal, still make decisions primarily on the basis of the 'high politics' of national security and economic material interests. Development, human rights and ethical/moral arguments for global health assistance, the traditional 'low politics' of foreign policy, are present in discourse but do not appear to dominate practice. While political momentum for health as a foreign policy goal persists, the framing of this goal remains a contested issue. The analysis offered in this article may prove helpful to those engaged in global health diplomacy or in efforts to have global governance across a range of sectoral interests pay more attention to health equity impacts.},

This study was performed to investigate the relationship between social economic status and asthma in Korean children. Methods: Data were acquired from 4,397 children, aged under 18 years who participated in the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which was conducted from 2010 to 2012. The presence of asthma was based on self-reported, physician-diagnosed asthma in the Health Interview Surveys. Results: The prevalence of pediatric asthma was 5.3\%, while the prevalence of atopic dermatitis in children was 14.0\%. In univariate analysis, asthmatic children tended to be male, to be older, to have asthmatic mothers, to suffer from atopic dermatitis and to live in urban areas (P{$<$} 0.05). The parents' marital status, employment status, education level, and the number of household members were not associated with pediatric asthma. In logistic regression analysis, older age, male sex, maternal asthma, pediatric atopic dermatitis, and urban residence were associated with a higher prevalence of childhood asthma (P{$<$} 0.01). Conclusion: Socioeconomic status was not an important risk factor for asthma in Korean children in our study. It is conceivable that socioeconomic factor could affect the asthma prevalence in a different manner in each country.

  abstract = {Real-time nonlinear stabilization techniques are often limited by inefficient or intractable online and/or offline computations, or a lack guarantee for global stability. In this paper, we explore the use of Control Contraction Metrics (CCM) for nonlinear stabilization because it offers tractable offline computations that give formal guarantees for global stability. We provide a method to solve the associated online computation for a CCM controller - a pseudospectral method to find a geodesic. Through a case study of a stiff nonlinear system, we highlight two key benefits: (i) using CCM for nonlinear stabilization and (ii) rapid online computations amenable to real-time implementation. We compare the performance of a CCM controller with other popular feedback control techniques, namely the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). We show that a CCM controller using a pseudospectral approach for online computations is a middle ground between the simplicity of LQR and stability guarantees for NMPC.},

When a cat drops in the upside-down posture with zero angular momentum, it can always right itself and land on its feet safely. Inspired by this biological phenomenon, we studied the optimal falling trajectory for adjusting the attitude of the falling cat robot. Firstly, we formulated a mathematical model based on the twisted model of two identical axially symmetric rigid cylinders, owing to nonintegrable conservation laws, a problem for controlling the attitude of the falling cat robot could be transformed to the problem of the nonholonomic motion planning. Then, taking the energy cost of the joint of the system as the optimal control function to find a control torque input, which was approximated by the spline approximation, with the method one can solve the problem that the initial and terminal values of control torque input are not zero. We found the optimal solution of control function through particle swarm optimization. Finally, we carried out numerical simulation, and the result shows the spline approximation is a valid method for trajectory planning of the falling cat robot.},

  abstract = {Differentiable physics has recently been shown as a powerful tool for solving soft-body manipulation tasks. However, the differentiable physics solver often gets stuck when the initial contact points of the end effectors are sub-optimal or when performing multi-stage tasks that require contact point switching, which often leads to local minima. To address this challenge, we propose a contact point discovery approach (CPDeform) that guides the stand-alone differentiable physics solver to deform various soft-body plasticines. The key idea of our approach is to integrate optimal transport-based contact points discovery into the differentiable physics solver to overcome the local minima from initial contact points or contact switching. On single-stage tasks, our method can automatically find suitable initial contact points based on transport priorities. On complex multi-stage tasks, we can iteratively switch the contact points of end-effectors based on transport priorities. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we introduce PlasticineLab-M that extends the existing differentiable physics benchmark PlasticineLab to seven new challenging multi-stage soft-body manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results suggest that: 1) on multi-stage tasks that are infeasible for the vanilla differentiable physics solver, our approach discovers contact points that efficiently guide the solver to completion; 2) on tasks where the vanilla solver performs sub-optimally or near-optimally, our contact point discovery method performs better than or on par with the manipulation performance obtained with handcrafted contact points.},

Reinforcement learning approaches for dexterous rigid object manipulation would struggle in this setting due to the complexity of physics interaction with deformable objects. At the same time, previous trajectory optimization approaches with differentiable physics for deformable manipulation would suffer from local optima caused by the explosion of contact modes from hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose DexDeform, a principled framework that abstracts dexterous manipulation skills from human demonstration, and refines the learned skills with differentiable physics. Concretely, we first collect a small set of human demonstrations using teleoperation. And we then train a skill model using demonstrations for planning over action abstractions in imagination. To explore the goal space, we further apply augmentations to the existing deformable shapes in demonstrations and use a gradient optimizer to refine the actions planned by the skill model. Finally, we adopt the refined trajectories as new demonstrations for finetuning the skill model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a suite of six challenging dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. Compared with baselines, DexDeform is able to better explore and generalize across novel goals unseen in the initial human demonstrations.

Similarly, robots may benefit from specialized tools that enable them to more easily complete a variety of tasks. We present an end-to-end framework to automatically learn tool morphology for contact-rich manipulation tasks by leveraging differentiable physics simulators. Previous work relied on manually constructed priors requiring detailed specification of a 3D object model, grasp pose and task description to facilitate the search or optimization process. Our approach only requires defining the objective with respect to task performance and enables learning a robust morphology through randomizing variations of the task. We make this optimization tractable by casting it as a continual learning problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for designing new tools in several scenarios, such as winding ropes, flipping a box and pushing peas onto a scoop in simulation. Additionally, experiments with real robots show that the tool shapes discovered by our method help them succeed in these scenarios.},

Previous works have shown that differentiable physics simulators provide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory optimization to converge orders of magnitude faster than model-free reinforcement learning algorithms for deformable object manipulation. However, such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill, that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a gradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in a differentiable simulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills by finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We show the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object manipulation tasks compared to previous reinforcement learning algorithms and compared to the trajectory optimizer.},

Previous methods typically either focus on short-horizon tasks or make strong assumptions that full-state information is available, which prevents their use on deformable objects. In this paper, we propose PlAnning with Spatial-Temporal Abstraction (PASTA), which incorporates both spatial abstraction (reasoning about objects and their relations to each other) and temporal abstraction (reasoning over skills instead of low-level actions). Our framework maps high-dimension 3D observations such as point clouds into a set of latent vectors and plans over skill sequences on top of the latent set representation. We show that our method can effectively perform challenging sequential deformable object manipulation tasks in the real world, which require combining multiple tool-use skills such as cutting with a knife, pushing with a pusher, and spreading dough with a roller.

  abstract = {Robot manipulation of rope-like objects is an interesting problem that has some critical applications, such as autonomous robotic suturing. Solving for and controlling rope is difficult due to the complexity of rope physics and the challenge of building fast and accurate models of deformable materials. While more data-driven approaches have become more popular for finding controllers that learn to do a single task, there is still a strong motivation for a model-based method that could be used to solve a large variety of optimization problems. Towards this end, we introduced compliant, position-based dynamics (XPBD) to model rope-like objects. Using geometric constraints, the model can represent the coupling of shear/stretch and bend/twist effects. Of crucial importance is that our formulation is differentiable, which can solve parameter estimation problems and improve the matching of rope physics to real-life scenarios (i.e., the real-to-sim problem). For the generality of rope-like objects, two different solvers are proposed to handle the inextensible and extensible effects of varied material stiffness for the rope. We demonstrate our framework's robustness and accuracy on real-to-sim experimental setups using the Baxter robot and the da Vinci research kit (DVRK). Our work leads to a new path for robotic manipulation of the deformable rope-like object taking advantage of the ready-to-use gradients.},

This article critically reviews such rape prevention education with particular focus on common techniques such as: “debunking” rape mythology, generating participant interaction, providing sexuality education and a feminist orientation, and avoiding confrontational approaches. Finally, theoretical and practical concerns are discussed regarding previous experiences of sexual victimization or perpetration, the conceptualization and use of outcome measures, issues of program facilitation, and processes underlying change in rape-supportive ideologies.

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization offers mature tools for motion planning in high-dimensional spaces under dynamic constraints. However, when facing complex configuration spaces, cluttered with obstacles, roboticists typically fall back to sampling-based planners that struggle in very high dimensions and with continuous differential constraints. Indeed, obstacles are the source of many textbook examples of problematic nonconvexities in the trajectory-optimization problem. Here we show that convex optimization can, in fact, be used to reliably plan trajectories around obstacles. Specifically, we consider planning problems with collision-avoidance constraints, as well as cost penalties and hard constraints on the shape, the duration, and the velocity of the trajectory. Combining the properties of B\textbackslash 'ezier curves with a recently-proposed framework for finding shortest paths in Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS), we formulate the planning problem as a compact mixed-integer optimization. In stark contrast with existing mixed-integer planners, the convex relaxation of our programs is very tight, and a cheap rounding of its solution is typically sufficient to design globally-optimal trajectories. This reduces the mixed-integer program back to a simple convex optimization, and automatically provides optimality bounds for the planned trajectories. We name the proposed planner GCS, after its underlying optimization framework. We demonstrate GCS in simulation on a variety of robotic platforms, including a quadrotor flying through buildings and a dual-arm manipulator (with fourteen degrees of freedom) moving in a confined space. Using numerical experiments on a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator, we show that GCS can outperform widely-used sampling-based planners by finding higher-quality trajectories in less time.},

  abstract = {Given a graph, the shortest-path problem requires finding a sequence of edges with minimum cumulative length that connects a source vertex to a target vertex. We consider a variant of this classical problem in which the position of each vertex in the graph is a continuous decision variable constrained in a convex set, and the length of an edge is a convex function of the position of its endpoints. Problems of this form can be shown to arise in many areas, from motion planning of autonomous vehicles to optimal control of hybrid systems. The price for such a wide applicability is the complexity of this problem, which is easily seen to be NP-hard. Our main contribution is a strong and lightweight mixed-integer convex formulation based on perspective functions, that makes it possible to efficiently find globally-optimal paths in large graphs and in high-dimensional spaces.},

This article reviews previous research on effective resistance to sexual assault, showing that self-defense is a well-established protective factor in a public health model of sexual assault prevention. The article goes on to show, through an examination of campus rape prevention efforts framed as “primary prevention,” that self-defense is routinely excluded. This creates a hidden curriculum that preserves a gender status quo even while it strives for change. The article concludes with recommendations for how administrators, educators, facilitators, funding agencies, and others can incorporate self-defense into campus RPE for a more effective, data-driven set of sexual assault prevention efforts. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

Conversations were reliably coded for degree of personal meaning communicated and listener scaffolding behavior. Results showed that friends showed less frequent explicit scaffolding of narrative identity than mothers, although listener scaffolding behavior was associated with adolescent meaning-making for both friends and mothers. Additional qualitative analysis of the conversations suggests that friends may be more engaged in scaffolding the self-presentational aspects of narrative identity, as well as providing a safe arena for exploration away from mothers.

Percentages and 95\% confidence intervals compare parents' perception of child readiness to learn about sexual issues, communication effectiveness, and dyad concordance from baseline to 12 months postintervention. Wilcoxon rank sum tests compare the changes in scores measuring communication content in HIV/AIDS, abstinence, and condom use. Compared to control, parents in the enhanced arm increased perception of child readiness to learn about sex (16\% vs. 29\%; p less than 0.001), and a greater proportion of parent-child dyads reported concordant responses on communication topics: HIV/AIDS (15\%, 95\% CI = 8-21\%; p less than 0.001), abstinence (13\%, 95\% CI = 7-20\%; p less than 0.001), condoms (15\%, 95\% CI = 9-22\%; p less than 0.001).

In machine learning research, this gradient problem lies at the core of many learning problems, in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. We will generally seek to rewrite such gradients in a form that allows for Monte Carlo estimation, allowing them to be easily and efficiently used and analysed. We explore three strategies--the pathwise, score function, and measure-valued gradient estimators--exploring their historical development, derivation, and underlying assumptions. We describe their use in other fields, show how they are related and can be combined, and expand on their possible generalisations. Wherever Monte Carlo gradient estimators have been derived and deployed in the past, important advances have followed. A deeper and more widely-held understanding of this problem will lead to further advances, and it is these advances that we wish to support.},

This paper presents a simple strategy to manipulate unknown objects using a robotic hand equipped with tactile sensors. The hand configurations that allow the rotation of an unknown object are computed using only tactile and kinematic information, obtained during the manipulation process and reasoning about the desired and real positions of the fingertips during the manipulation. This is done taking into account that the desired positions of the fingertips are not physically reachable since they are located in the interior of the manipulated object and therefore they are virtual positions with associated virtual contact points. The proposed approach was satisfactorily validated using three fingers of an anthropomorphic robotic hand (Allegro Hand), with the original fingertips replaced by tactile sensors (WTS-FT). In the experimental validation, several everyday objects with different shapes were successfully manipulated, rotating them without the need of knowing their shape or any other physical property.},

We first show how smooth continuous-time trajectories can be represented by a small number of states using sparse Gaussian process (GP) models. We next develop an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm that exploits this sparsity and GP interpolation. We call this algorithm the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP). We then detail how motion planning problems can be formulated as probabilistic inference on a factor graph. This forms the basis for GPMP2, a very efficient algorithm that combines GP representations of trajectories with fast, structure-exploiting inference via numerical optimization. Finally, we extend GPMP2 to an incremental algorithm, iGPMP2, that can efficiently replan when conditions change. We benchmark our algorithms against several sampling-based and trajectory optimization-based motion planning algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that GPMP2 is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. We also benchmark iGPMP2 on replanning problems, and show that it can find successful solutions in a fraction of the time required by GPMP2 to replan from scratch.},

It generates robotic motion trajectories after obtaining object motion using an optimization-based algorithm. With the proposed method's help, we can plan contact-rich manipulation without particularly analyzing an object's contact modes and their transitions. The planner and optimizer determine them automatically. We conducted experiments and analyses using simulations and real-world executions to examine the method's performance. It can successfully find manipulation motion that met contact, force, and kinematic constraints, thus allowing a mobile manipulator to move heavy objects while leveraging supporting forces from environmental obstacles. The mehtod does not need to explicitly analyze contact states and build contact transition graphs, thus providing a new view for robotic grasp-less manipulation, non-prehensile manipulation, manipulation with contact, etc.},

Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, we show eight different tasks, which would require very different control structures when solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory optimization approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrate our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that we are able to run the optimization online.

A parallel is drawn to other individual-centered statistical approaches such as cluster analysis (CA) and sequence analysis (SA). Depending on the research question and type of data, a number of approaches can be used for trajectory modelling of health outcomes measured in longitudinal studies. However, the various terms to designate latent class modelling approaches (GMM, GBTM, LTA, LCA) are used inconsistently and often inter-changeably in the available scientific literature. Improved consistency in the terminology and reporting guidelines have the potential to increase researchers' efficiency when it comes to choosing the most appropriate technique that best suits their research questions.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES–Symptomatic colds and asthma exacerbations; objective exacerbations of asthma with {$>$} or = 50 l/min reduction in mean peak expiratory flow rate when morning and night time readings on days 1-7 after onset of symptoms were compared with rates during an asymptomatic control period; laboratory confirmed respiratory tract infections. RESULTS–Colds were reported in 80\% (223/280) of episodes with symptoms of wheeze, chest tightness, or breathlessness, and 89\% (223/250) of colds were associated with asthma symptoms. 24\% of 115 laboratory confirmed non-bacterial infections were associated with reductions in mean peak expiratory flow rate {$>$} or = 50 l/min through days 1-7 and 48\% had mean decreases {$>$} or = 25 l/min. 44\% of episodes with mean decreases in flow rate {$>$} or = 50 l/min were associated with laboratory confirmed infections. Infections with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and chlamydia were all associated with objective evidence of an exacerbation of asthma. CONCLUSIONS–These findings show that asthma symptoms and reductions in peak flow are often associated with colds and respiratory viruses; respiratory virus infections commonly cause or are associated with exacerbations of asthma in adults.},

The ability to deform soft objects remains a great challenge for robots due to difficulties in defining the problem mathematically. In this paper, we address the problem of shaping a piece of dough-like deformable material into a 2D target shape presented upfront. We use a 6 degree-of-freedom WidowX-250 Robot Arm equipped with a rolling pin and information collected from an RGB-D camera and a tactile sensor. We present and compare several control policies, including a dough shrinking action, in extensive experiments across three kinds of deformable materials and across three target dough shape sizes, achieving the intersection over union (IoU) of 0.90. Our results show that: i) rolling dough from the highest dough point is more efficient than from the 2D/3D dough centroid; ii) it might be better to stop the roll movement at the current dough boundary as opposed to the target shape outline; iii) the shrink action might be beneficial only if properly tuned with respect to the expand action; and iv) the Play-Doh material is easier to shape to a target shape as compared to Plasticine or Kinetic sand.

  abstract = {Dynamic multi-contact behaviors, such as locomotion and item manipulation, remain a challenge for today's robotic systems. This is primarily due to the discontinuous and non-smooth dynamics introduced by contacts. For mobile manipulators (e.g., humanoids) to become useful for dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks, such as those in disaster response, they need to be capable of interacting with their cluttered, constrained, and changing environments. It is therefore essential to develop methods that would enable robots to plan and execute contact-rich motions in dynamic surroundings. In this dissertation research, we investigate the planning of contact-interaction trajectories and utilize numerical optimal control techniques to solve this problem in a generalizable and computationally-tractable way. We develop a contact-implicit trajectory optimization framework for the automatic discovery of dynamic contact-rich behaviors given only a high-level goal, i.e., the desired configuration of the environment. A variable smooth contact model is introduced to improve the convergence of gradient-based optimization without compromising the physical fidelity of the resulting motions. This is achieved by employing smooth virtual forces that act as a decoupled relaxation of rigid-body contact dynamics. Second, we develop a sequential convex optimization procedure that provides reliable convergence characteristics while solving this non-convex problem. Third, a penalty loop approach is proposed to generalize this method to a wide range of robots and tasks. The proposed methodology provides an out-of-the-box planning framework for a broad spectrum of contact-interaction trajectories. Moreover, the planned motions are physically realistic enough that they can be immediately executed on hardware by using only a standard position-tracking controller. Last, we propose the use of state-triggered constraints (STCs) in the planning and control of contact-interaction trajectories. STCs are a more modular alternative to complementarity constraints which are widely used in this domain to incorporate discrete elements into continuous optimization. As example use cases, we develop a novel reformulation of the Coulomb friction model and an automatic contact constraint activation method based on STCs. Our extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed STC-based approaches provide a significant improvement with respect to the prior art in terms of both computational efficiency and robustness, indicating the immense promise of STCs to efficiently model rich discrete aspects of contact-related problems. Thus, this dissertation presents methods that enable the generalized and computationally-efficient planning of dynamic contact-rich behaviors for a broad range of robotic applications without requiring any heuristics or tuning.},

  abstract = {This report investigates the use of unsupervised probabilistic learning techniques for the analysis of hypersonic trajectories. The algorithm first extracts the intrinsic structure in the data via a diffusion map approach. Using the diffusion coordinates on the graph of training samples, the probabilistic framework augments the original data with samples that are statistically consistent with the original set. The augmented samples are then used to construct conditional statistics that are ultimately assembled in a path-planing algorithm. In this framework the controls are determined stage by stage during the flight to adapt to changing mission objectives in real-time. A 3DOF model was employed to generate optimal hypersonic trajectories that comprise the training datasets. The diffusion map algorithm identfied that data resides on manifolds of much lower dimensionality compared to the high-dimensional state space that describes each trajectory. In addition to the path-planing worflow we also propose an algorithm that utilizes the diffusion map coordinates along the manifold to label and possibly remove outlier samples from the training data. This algorithm can be used to both identify edge cases for further analysis as well as to remove them from the training set to create a more robust set of samples to be used for the path-planing process.},

Here we present a "contact-aware" controller which continues to execute a given trajectory despite unexpected collisions while keeping the contact force stable and small. We introduce a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, which minimizes a trajectory-tracking error subject to quasistatic dynamics and contact-force constraints. Compared with the classical null-space projection technique, the inequality constraint on contact forces in the proposed QP controller allows for more gentle release when the robot comes out of contact. In the quasistatic dynamics model, control actions consist only of commanded joint positions, allowing the QP controller to run on stiffness-controlled robots which do not have a straightforward torque-control interface nor accurate dynamic models. The effectiveness of the proposed QP controller is demonstrated on a KUKA iiwa arm.},

  abstract = {The empirical success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the setting of contact-rich manipulation leaves much to be understood from a model-based perspective, where the key difficulties are often attributed to (i) the explosion of contact modes, (ii) stiff, non-smooth contact dynamics and the resulting exploding / discontinuous gradients, and (iii) the non-convexity of the planning problem. The stochastic nature of RL addresses (i) and (ii) by effectively sampling and averaging the contact modes. On the other hand, model-based methods have tackled the same challenges by smoothing contact dynamics analytically. Our first contribution is to establish the theoretical equivalence of the two methods for simple systems, and provide qualitative and empirical equivalence on a number of complex examples. In order to further alleviate (ii), our second contribution is a convex, differentiable and quasi-dynamic formulation of contact dynamics, which is amenable to both smoothing schemes, and has proven through experiments to be highly effective for contact-rich planning. Our final contribution resolves (iii), where we show that classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms can be effective in global planning when contact modes are abstracted via smoothing. Applying our method on a collection of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that efficient model-based motion planning can achieve results comparable to RL with dramatically less computation.

Effective HIV prevention programs for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) are important to reduce new infections and to ensure PLWH remain healthy. This paper describes the systematic adaptation of a U.S.-developed Evidence Based Intervention (EBI) using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Map of Adaption Process for use at a Pediatric Hospital in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The adapted intervention, Supporting Youth and Motivating Positive Action or SYMPA, a six-session risk reduction intervention targeted for youth living with HIV/AIDS (YLWH) in Kinshasa was adapted from the Healthy Living Project and guided by the Social Action Theory. This paper describes the process of implementing the first four steps of the ADAPT framework (Assess, Select, Prepare, and Pilot). Our study has shown that an EBI developed and implemented in the U.S. can be adapted successfully for a different target population in a low-resource context through an iterative process following the CDC ADAPT framework. This process included reviewing existing literature, adapting and adding components, and focusing on increasing staff capacity.

But when she conducts cervical cancer screening in Botswana, she employs a much simpler diagnostic strategy. She applies acetic acid to highlight precancerous lesions and visually inspects the cervix?a technique known as the VIA (visual inspection with acetic acid) method. She treats suspicious lesions with cryotherapy. There are multiple reasons that Dr. Hortense uses VIA in developing countries. It requires no specialized laboratory facilities or highly trained personnel. With immediate results, there is no delay in diagnosis and treatment, ensuring that patients are not lost to follow?up. Most importantly, VIA is considerably cheaper than Pap and HPV co?testing. This difference in care between Chicago and Botswana presents an ethical dilemma in global health: is it ethically acceptable to provide some patients cheaper treatments that are less effective or more toxic than the treatments other patients receive? We argue that it is ethical to consider local resource constraints when deciding what interventions to provide. The provision of cheaper, less effective health care is frequently the most effective way of promoting health and realizing the ethical values of utility, equality, and priority to the worst off.},

Such methods efficiently find solutions even for high degree-of-freedom robots. However, a globally optimal solution is often intractable in practice and state-of-the-art trajectory optimization methods are thus prone to local minima, especially in cluttered environments. In this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm that employs stochastic optimization based on the cross-entropy method in order to tackle the local minima problem. We represent trajectories as samples from a continuous-time Gaussian process and introduce heteroscedasticity to generate powerful trajectory priors better suited for collision avoidance in motion planning problems. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach yields a more thorough exploration of the solution space and a higher success rate in complex environments than a current Gaussian process based state-of-the-art trajectory optimization method, namely GPMP2, while having comparable execution time.},

  abstract = {We investigate the incremental stability properties of It\textbackslash\^o stochastic dynamical systems. Specifically, we derive a stochastic version of nonlinear contraction theory that provides a bound on the mean square distance between any two trajectories of a stochastically contracting system. This bound can be expressed as a function of the noise intensity and the contraction rate of the noise-free system. We illustrate these results in the contexts of stochastic nonlinear observers design and stochastic synchronization.},

  abstract = {The Expert Panel Report 3 of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program represents a major advance in the approach to asthma care by emphasizing the monitoring of clinically relevant aspects of care and the importance of planned primary care, and by providing patients practical tools for self-management. Treatment of asthma should be guided by a new system of classification that assesses severity at initial evaluation and control at all subsequent visits. Asthma severity is determined by current impairment (as evidenced by impact on day-to-day activities) and risk of future exacerbations (as evidenced by frequency of oral systemic corticosteroid use), and allows categorization of disease as intermittent, persistent-mild, persistent-moderate, and persistent-severe. Initial treatment is guided by the disease-severity category. The degree of control is also determined by the analysis of current impairment and future risk. Validated questionnaires can be used for following the impairment domain of control with patients whose asthma is categorized as “well controlled,” “not well controlled,” and “very poorly controlled.” Decisions about medication adjustment and planned follow-up are based on the category of disease control. Whereas a stepwise approach for asthma management continues to be recommended, the number of possible steps has increased.},

  abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

Evaluation results showed the adapted EBI retained its effectiveness, successfully increasing parent-child sexual communication and parenting skills. Our experience suggests an EBI can be successfully adapted for a new context if it is relevant to local needs, the process is led by a multidisciplinary team with community representation, and pilot-testing and early implementation are well monitored.},

Results. Participants in the GE + CE intervention were twice as likely (P {$<$} .01) as those in the comparison group to show increased support for gender-equitable norms between the baseline and end-line points. Also, the percentage of GE + CE participants who reported IPV toward their partner in the preceding 6 months decreased from 53\% to 38\% between baseline and end line, and the percentage in the CE-only group decreased from 60\% to 37\%; changes were negligible in the comparison group.

While the task is seemingly intuitive for humans, there exist local optima for common approaches such as naive trajectory optimization. We propose a novel trajectory optimizer that optimizes through a differentiable “reset” module, transforming a single-stage, fixed-initialization trajectory into a multistage, multi-initialization trajectory where all stages are optimized jointly. We then train a closed-loop policy on the demonstrations generated by our trajectory optimizer. Our policy receives partial point clouds as input, allowing ease of transfer from simulation to the real world. We show that our policy can perform real-world dough manipulation, flattening a ball of dough into a target shape.},

This article draws on writings by Winnicott and Ogden and on current discourse about sexuality in the Arab world to explore how LGBT Arab clients responded to initial phases of therapy with an Arab, traditional, psycho-dynamically trained female therapist. We focus specifically on the notions of true and false self, transitional space, and on role of naming in creating safe transitional therapeutic space where Arab, traditional LGBT clients came to express their unique thoughts and desires related to their non-heterosexual orientations. We also illustrate how clients came to share and experience ‘unlived’ parts of their sexual identities and describe common aspects of the transference and countertransference relationships. Change, experienced differently by clients and the therapist, was a central theme in the early transference and countertransference relationship. Names became an important port of entry and facilitated the creation of a safe transitional space with my clients. Words helped to humanise what had been unspeakable and unbearable experience and allowed clients to begin to openly accept and share the realities of their sexual orientations even within the confines of severe social and cultural demands.},

The objective of this study was to explore a mapping approach to represent the spatial distribution of ecosyndemics in Piura, Peru at the district-level during the first few months of 1998. Using geographic information systems and multivariate analysis, descriptive and analytical methodologies were employed to map disease overlap of 7 climate-sensitive diseases and construct an ecosyndemic index, which was then mapped and applied to another El Nino period as proof of concept. The main findings showed that many districts across Piura faced multi-disease risk over several weeks in the austral summer of 1998. The distribution of ecosyndemics were spatially clustered in western Piura among 11 districts. Furthermore, the ecosydemic index in 1998 when compared to 1983 showed a strong positive correlation, demonstrating the potential utility of the index. The study supports PAHO efforts to develop multi-disease based and interprogrammatic approaches to control and prevention, particularly for climate and poverty-related infections in Latin America and the Caribbean.},

The sample included 100 mothers and their 7-, 11-, or 16-year-old children; each dyad discussed events when the child (a) helped a friend and (b) hurt a friend. Analyses suggested that conversations about help may serve to facilitate children’s sense of themselves as prosocial moral agents; mothers focused on children’s feelings of pride, positive judgments of the child’s behavior, and positive insights about the child’s characteristics that could be drawn from the event. In turn, conversations about harm were more elaborated and contentious than those about help, and reflected more complex maternal goals; although mothers highlighted children’s wrongdoing (e.g., by noting negative consequences of the child’s actions for others), they also engaged in a variety of strategies that may support children’s ability to reconcile their harmful actions with a positive self-view (e.g., by noting what children did do well or their capacity for repair). With respect to age effects, results revealed that older children played an increasingly active and spontaneous role in discussions. Furthermore, as compared with 7-year-olds, conversations with 11- and 16-year-olds focused more on psychological insights that could be drawn from experiences and less on children’s concrete harmful and helpful actions. Overall, results illuminate the processes whereby conversations with mothers may further children’s developing understandings of their own and others’ moral agency, and how discussions of prosocial and transgressive moral experiences may provide distinct but complementary opportunities for moral socialization.},

Food, water, and treatment in the home, yard, and school are all potential sources of children's exposure. Exposures to pesticides may be overt or subacute, and effects range from acute to chronic toxicity. In 2008, pesticides were the ninth most common substance reported to poison control centers, and approximately 45\% of all reports of pesticide poisoning were for children. Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning are perhaps the most widely known acute poisoning syndromes, can be diagnosed by depressed red blood cell cholinesterase levels, and have available antidotal therapy. However, numerous other pesticides that may cause acute toxicity, such as pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and rodenticides, also have specific toxic effects; recognition of these effects may help identify acute exposures. Evidence is increasingly emerging about chronic health implications from both acute and chronic exposure. A growing body of epidemiological evidence demonstrates associations between parental use of pesticides, particularly insecticides, with acute lymphocytic leukemia and brain tumors. Prenatal, household, and occupational exposures (maternal and paternal) appear to be the largest risks. Prospective cohort studies link early-life exposure to organophosphates and organochlorine pesticides (primarily DDT) with adverse effects on neurodevelopment and behavior. Among the findings associated with increased pesticide levels are poorer mental development by using the Bayley index and increased scores on measures assessing pervasive developmental disorder, inattention, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Related animal toxicology studies provide supportive biological plausibility for these findings. Additional data suggest that there may also be an association between parental pesticide use and adverse birth outcomes including physical birth defects, low birth weight, and fetal death, although the data are less robust than for cancer and neuro-developmental effects. Children's exposures to pesticides should be limited as much as possible. Pediatrics 2012;130:e1765-e1788},

We maintain the ability to treat the key desirable aspects of rigid bodies (e.g. contact, collision, stacking, and friction) and deformable bodies (e.g. arbitrary constitutive models, thin shells, and self-collisions). In addition, our simulation framework supports more advanced features such as proportional derivative controlled articulation between rigid bodies. This not only allows for the robust simulation of a number of new phenomena, but also directly lends itself to the design of deformable creatures with proportional derivative controlled articulated rigid skeletons that interact in a life-like way with their environment.},

  abstract = {Modeling and manipulating elasto-plastic objects are essential capabilities for robots to perform complex industrial and household interaction tasks (e.g., stuffing dumplings, rolling sushi, and making pottery). However, due to the high degree of freedom of elasto-plastic objects, significant challenges exist in virtually every aspect of the robotic manipulation pipeline, e.g., representing the states, modeling the dynamics, and synthesizing the control signals. We propose to tackle these challenges by employing a particle-based representation for elasto-plastic objects in a model-based planning framework. Our system, RoboCraft, only assumes access to raw RGBD visual observations. It transforms the sensing data into particles and learns a particle-based dynamics model using graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the structure of the underlying system. The learned model can then be coupled with model-predictive control (MPC) algorithms to plan the robot's behavior. We show through experiments that with just 10 minutes of real-world robotic interaction data, our robot can learn a dynamics model that can be used to synthesize control signals to deform elasto-plastic objects into various target shapes, including shapes that the robot has never encountered before. We perform systematic evaluations in both simulation and the real world to demonstrate the robot's manipulation capabilities and ability to generalize to a more complex action space, different tool shapes, and a mixture of motion modes. We also conduct comparisons between RoboCraft and untrained human subjects controlling the gripper to manipulate deformable objects in both simulation and the real world. Our learned model-based planning framework is comparable to and sometimes better than human subjects on the tested tasks.},

  abstract = {Arboreal~animals face numerous challenges when negotiating complex three-dimensional terrain. Directed aerial descent or gliding flight allows for rapid traversal of arboreal environments, but presents control challenges. Some animals, such as birds or gliding squirrels, have specialized structures to modulate aerodynamic forces while airborne. However, many arboreal animals do not possess these specializations but still control posture and orientation in mid-air. One of the largest inertial segments in lizards is their tail. Inertial reorientation can be used to attain postures appropriate for controlled aerial descent. Here, we discuss the role of tail inertia in a range of mid-air reorientation behaviors using experimental data from geckos in combination with mathematical and robotic models. Geckos can self-right in mid-air by tail rotation alone. Equilibrium glide behavior of geckos in a vertical wind tunnel show that they can steer toward a visual stimulus by using rapid, circular tail rotations to control pitch and yaw. Multiple coordinated tail responses appear to be required for the most effective terminal velocity gliding. A mathematical model allows us to explore the relationship between morphology and the capacity for inertial reorientation by conducting sensitivity analyses, and testing control approaches. Robotic models further define the limits of performance and generate new control hypotheses. Such comparative analysis allows predictions about the diversity of performance across lizard morphologies, relative limb proportions, and provides insights into the evolution of aerial behaviors.},

We agree with those who have argued for the wider adoption of agent-based modelling (ABM) in taking on these challenges. However, while ABM has been used occasionally in population health, we argue that for ABM to be most effective in the field it should be used as a means for answering questions normally inaccessible to the traditional epidemiological toolkit. In an effort to clearly illustrate the utility of ABM for population health research, and to clear up persistent misunderstandings regarding the method's conceptual underpinnings, we offer a detailed presentation of the core concepts of complex systems theory, and summarise why simulations are essential to the study of complex systems. We then examine the current state of the art in ABM for population health, and propose they are well-suited for the study of the 'wicked' problems in population health, and could make significant contributions to theory and intervention development in these areas.},

The key idea is to develop a new control-theoretic regularizer for dynamics fitting rooted in the notion of stabilizability, which guarantees that the learned system can be accompanied by a robust controller capable of stabilizing any open-loop trajectory that the system may generate. By leveraging tools from contraction theory, statistical learning, and convex optimization, we provide a general and tractable semi-supervised algorithm to learn stabilizable dynamics, which can be applied to complex underactuated systems. We validated the proposed algorithm on a simulated planar quadrotor system and observed notably improved trajectory generation and tracking performance with the control-theoretic regularized model over models learned using traditional regression techniques, especially when using a small number of demonstration examples. The results presented illustrate the need to infuse standard model-based reinforcement learning algorithms with concepts drawn from nonlinear control theory for improved reliability.},

In an offline phase, one computes the structure of a feedback controller that can be efficiently implemented online to track any feasible nominal trajectory. The offline phase leverages contraction theory and convex optimization to characterize a fixed-size " tube " that the state is guaranteed to remain within while tracking a nominal trajectory (representing the center of the tube). In the online phase, when the robot is faced with obstacles, a motion planner uses such a tube as a robustness margin for collision checking, yielding nominal trajectories that can be safely executed (i.e., tracked without collisions under disturbances). In contrast to recent work on robust online planning using funnel libraries, our approach is not restricted to a fixed library of maneuvers computed offline and is thus particularly well-suited to applications such as UAV flight in densely cluttered environments where complex maneuvers may be required to reach a goal. We demonstrate our approach through simulations of a 6-state planar quadrotor navigating cluttered environments in the presence of a crosswind. We also discuss applications of our approach to Tube Model Predictive Control (TMPC) and compare the merits of our method with state-of-the-art nonlinear TMPC techniques.},

  abstract = {Any biological object, and specifically the brain, is the result of evolution. Evolution proceeds by accumulation and combination of stable intermediate states—as is well known, survival of the fittest really means survival of the stable. Simple examples abound: for instance, human emotional response involves both a fast archaic loop bypassing the cortex, and a slower cortical loop; motion control architecture in vertebrates is believed to involve combinations of simple motor primitives. However, in themselves, accumulations and combinations of stable elements have no reason to be stable. Hence the hypothesis that evolution will favor a particular form of stability, which automatically guarantees stability in combination. Such a form of stability, which we refer to as ‘contraction,’ can be characterized mathematically. Thus, contraction theory may help guide functional modeling of the central nervous system, and conversely it provides a systematic method to build arbitrarily complex robots out of simpler elements. Furthermore, contraction theory may shed light on the problem of perceptual unity (binding problem) by providing simple models and conditions for the overall convergence of a large number of specialized processing elements connected through networks of feedback loops.},

Many such problems can be formulated as the minimization of functionals defined over a class of admissible domains. Shape optimization is quite indispensable in the design and construction of industrial structures. For example, aircraft and spacecraft have to satisfy, at the same time, very strict criteria on mechanical performance while weighing as little as possible. The shape optimization problem for such a structure consists in finding a geometry of the structure which minimizes a given functional (e. g. such as the weight of the structure) and yet simultaneously satisfies specific constraints (like thickness, strain energy, or displacement bounds). The geometry of the structure can be considered as a given domain in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The domain is an open, bounded set whose topology is given, e. g. it may be simply or doubly connected. The boundary is smooth or piecewise smooth, so boundary value problems that are defined in the domain and associated with the classical partial differential equations of mathematical physics are well posed. In general the cost functional takes the form of an integral over the domain or its boundary where the integrand depends smoothly on the solution of a boundary value problem.},

For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples comparable to GANs on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on CIFAR-10.

  abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\textbackslash aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},

Data were from the Lehigh Longitudinal Study (n\,=\,457), where subjects were assessed at preschool, elementary, adolescent, and adult ages. Multiple group path analysis tested the relationships between childhood household adversity; residential, school, and caregiver transitions; and adult socioeconomic outcomes for each group. Caregiver relationship quality was included as a moderator, and gender as a covariate. Household adversity was negatively associated with education level and positively associated with income problems for non-maltreated children only. For both groups, residential transitions was negatively associated with education level and caregiver transitions was positively associated with unemployment problems. Relationship quality was positively associated with education level only for non-maltreated children. For children who did not experience maltreatment, reducing exposure to household adversity is an important goal for prevention. Reducing exposure to child maltreatment for all children remains an important public health priority. Results underscore the need for programs and policies that promote stable relationships and environments.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the problem of verifying and computing optimal controls of systems whose dynamics is governed by differential systems with a discontinuous right-hand side. In our work, we are motivated by optimal control of mechanical systems with Coulomb friction, which exhibit such a right-hand side. Notwithstanding the impressive development of nonsmooth and set-valued analysis, these systems have not been closely studied either computationally or analytically. We show that even when the solution crosses and does not stay on the discontinuity, differentiating the results of a simulation gives gradients that have errors of a size independent of the stepsize. This means that the strategy of “optimize the discretization” will usually fail for problems of this kind. We approximate the discontinuous right-hand side for the differential equations or inclusions by a smooth right-hand side. For these smoothed approximations, we show that the resulting gradients approach the true gradients provided that the start and end points of the trajectory do not lie on the discontinuity and that Euler’s method is used where the step size is “sufficiently small” in comparison with the smoothing parameter. Numerical results are presented for a crude model of car racing that involves Coulomb friction and slip showing that this approach is practical and can handle problems of moderate complexity.},

Despite the importance caring adult relationships can play in promoting positive youth development and resiliency, there has been limited inquiry into the characteristics of the foster youth and caregiver relationship. The goal of this paper is to provide a descriptive account of the foster youth and caregiver relationship, and explore what qualities and experiences foster youth desire from their caregivers. Qualitative data were gathered from 9 focus groups. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis approaches. Foster youth, caregivers, and child welfare staff described relationships lacking in formative bonds and connection, where youth didn't "fit in", and chaotic homes marked by reactivity and judgment. Characteristics of supportive foster homes include a sense of belonging, structure, guidance, and consistency. This research underscores the important role positive relationships can play in foster youth's feelings of well-being and points to the need for foster parent training to include tangible strategies to develop stronger bonds.},

However, the high variance of zero-order Monte-Carlo gradient estimates results in slow convergence and a requirement for a high number of samples. By replacing these zero-order gradient estimates with first-order ones, differentiable simulators promise faster computation time for policy gradient methods when the model is known. Contrary to this belief, we highlight some of the pathologies of using first-order gradients and show that in many physical scenarios involving rich contact, using zero-order gradients result in better performance. Building on these pathologies and lessons, we propose guidelines for designing differentiable simulators, as well as policy optimization algorithms that use these simulators. By doing so, we hope to reap the benefits of first-order gradients while avoiding the potential pitfalls.},

Unlike conventional single-object manipulation pipelines, which estimate the state of the system parametrized by pose, the underlying physical state of this system is difficult to observe from images. Thus, we take the approach of reasoning directly in the space of images, and acquire the dynamics of visual measurements in order to synthesize a visual-feedback policy. We present a simple controller using an image-space Lyapunov function, and evaluate the closed-loop performance using three different class of models for image prediction: deep-learning-based models for image-to-image translation, an object-centric model obtained from treating each pixel as a particle, and a switched-linear system where an action-dependent linear map is used. Through results in simulation and experiment, we show that for this task, a linear model works surprisingly well – achieving better prediction error, downstream task performance, and generalization to new environments than the deep models we trained on the same amount of data. We believe these results provide an interesting example in the spectrum of models that are most useful for vision-based feedback in manipulation, considering both the quality of visual prediction, as well as compatibility with rigorous methods for control design and analysis.

Robots can perform more and more manipulation tasks that are still done by humans, and there is a growing number of publications on the topics of (1) performing tasks that always require contact and (2) mitigating uncertainty by leveraging the environment in tasks that, under perfect information, could be performed without contact. The recent trends have seen robots perform tasks earlier left for humans, such as massage, and in the classical tasks, such as peg-in-hole, there is a more efficient generalization to other similar tasks, better error tolerance, and faster planning or learning of the tasks. Thus, in this survey we cover the current stage of robots performing such tasks, starting from surveying all the different in-contact tasks robots can perform, observing how these tasks are controlled and represented, and finally presenting the learning and planning of the skills required to complete these tasks.},

In this paper, we push scholarship on ecosyndemics into new territory by using the ecosyndemic framework to compare two case studies—the Southern Interoceanic highway in Peru and the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in Brazil—to assess the likelihood of socio-environmental factors interacting and leading to ill health in a syndemic fashion. Assessing these two case studies using an ecosyndemic perspective, we find that the construction of dams and highways in tropical forests create the conditions for increases in vector-borne illnesses, surges in sex work and sexually-transmitted infections, and increased psychological stress resulting from violence, delinquency, and the erosion of social cohesion. We suggest that these processes could interact synergistically to increase an individual's immune burden and a population's overall morbidity. However, we find differences in the impacts of the Interoceanic highway and the Belo Monte dam on food, water, and cultural systems, and observed that community and corporate-level actions may bolster health in the face of rapid socio-ecological change. Looking at the case studies together, a complex picture of vulnerability and resilience, risk and opportunity, complicates straight-forward predictions of ecosyndemic interactions resulting from these development projects but highlights the role that the ecosyndemic concept can play in informing health impact assessments and future research. We conclude by proposing a conceptual model of the potential interactions between psychological stress, vector-borne illnesses, and sexaully-transmitted infections and suggest that future investigations of synergistic interactions among these factors draw from the biological, social, and ecological sciences. •Ecosyndemics are disease interactions ignited by eco-social changes.•We compared two Amazonian mega-development projects using an ecosyndemic framing.•Projects were Belo Monte dam in Brazil and the Interoceanic highway in Peru.•Potential synergism among stress, vector-borne and sexually-transmitted infections.•Researchers should use interdisciplinary methods to further examine dynamics.},

  abstract = {To navigate complex environments, robots must increasingly use high-dimensional visual feedback (e.g. images) for control. However, relying on high-dimensional image data to make control decisions raises important questions; particularly, how might we prove the safety of a visual-feedback controller? Control barrier functions (CBFs) are powerful tools for certifying the safety of feedback controllers in the state-feedback setting, but CBFs have traditionally been poorly-suited to visual feedback control due to the need to predict future observations in order to evaluate the barrier function. In this work, we solve this issue by leveraging recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs), which learn implicit representations of 3D scenes and can render images from previously-unseen camera perspectives, to provide single-step visual foresight for a CBF-based controller. This novel combination is able to filter out unsafe actions and intervene to preserve safety. We demonstrate the effect of our controller in real-time simulation experiments where it successfully prevents the robot from taking dangerous actions.},

  abstract = {Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.},

  abstract = {Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) are a highly expressive class of nonconvex optimization problems. While QCQPs are NP-hard in general, they admit a natural convex relaxation via the standard (Shor) semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation. Towards understanding when this relaxation is exact, we study general QCQPs and their (projected) SDP relaxations. We present sufficient (and in some cases, also necessary) conditions for objective value exactness (the condition that the objective values of the QCQP and its SDP relaxation coincide) and convex hull exactness (the condition that the convex hull of the QCQP epigraph coincides with the epigraph of its SDP relaxation). Our conditions for exactness are based on geometric properties of \$\textbackslash Gamma\$, the cone of convex Lagrange multipliers, and its relatives \$\textbackslash Gamma\_P\$ and \$\textbackslash Gamma\^\textbackslash circ\$. These tools form the basis of our main message: questions of exactness can be treated systematically whenever \$\textbackslash Gamma\$, \$\textbackslash Gamma\_P\$, or \$\textbackslash Gamma\^\textbackslash circ\$ is well-understood. As further evidence of this message, we apply our tools to address questions of exactness for a prototypical QCQP involving a binary on-off constraint, quadratic matrix programs, the QCQP formulation of the partition problem, and random and semi-random QCQPs.},

The aim of the present study was to determine whether viral infection in acute asthma was associated with increased sputum neutrophil degranulation and increased cellular lysis and whether these changes are related to clinical severity. Adults (n=49) presenting to the emergency department with acute asthma were examined for infection by means of sputum direct-fluorescence antigen detection, sputum culture, and sputum polymerase chain reaction for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Legionella pneumophila, and all common respiratory viruses. Subjects infected with one of these agents were classed as having an infective exacerbation. Spirometry and sputum induction were performed on presentation and 4-5 weeks later. Thirty-seven subjects (76\%) had virus infection and acute asthma. Those with virus infection had increased sputum neutrophils (p{$<$}0.05) and increased neutrophil elastase (p{$<$}0.05), this was related to increased elevated sputum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Subjects with noninfective asthma had an increase in the proportion of sputum eosinophils. Both groups had elevated sputum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) concentrations. Higher levels of sputum LDH and ECP were associated with a longer hospital stay. Virus infection and acute asthma is associated with neutrophilic inflammation, cell lysis and more severe clinical disease.},

One of the essential characteristics of flexible manufacturing is to track time-varying target trajectories (e.g. diversity and quantity of products).

  abstract = {This paper considers the analysis of continuous time gradient-based optimization algorithms through the lens of nonlinear contraction theory. It demonstrates that in the case of a time-invariant objective, most elementary results on gradient descent based on convexity can be replaced by much more general results based on contraction. In particular, gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if its dynamics are contracting in any metric, with convexity of the cost corresponding to the special case of contraction in the identity metric. More broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights for the case of geodesically-convex optimization, wherein non-convex problems in Euclidean space can be transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian manifold. In this case, natural gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if it is contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of the cost corresponding to contraction in the natural metric. New results using semi-contraction provide additional insights into the topology of the set of optimizers in the case when multiple optima exist. Furthermore, they show how semi-contraction may be combined with specific additional information to reach broad conclusions about a dynamical system. The contraction perspective also easily extends to time-varying optimization settings and allows one to recursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements. Extensions to natural primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts further illustrate the potential reach of these new perspectives.},

We point out the difficulty is that the heat flow is exactly solvable, but neither its forward nor backward method is implementable in general, except for Gaussian data. We propose the symmetrized Langevin algorithm (SLA), which should have a smaller bias than ULA, at the price of implementing a proximal gradient step in space. We show SLA is in fact consistent for Gaussian target measure, whereas ULA is not. We also illustrate various algorithms explicitly for Gaussian target measure with Gaussian data, including gradient descent, proximal gradient, and Forward-Backward, and show they are all consistent.},

  abstract = {Strategies aiming to increase the climate resilience of smallholder agricultural systems may not equally benefit all groups of the smallholder population. To reduce the potential for aggravating existing vulnerabilities, quantitative resilience analyses therefore need to acknowledge the possibility for inequities in the effects of proposed resilience-enhancing strategies (RESs). In this study, we develop, validate, and apply a household-level agent-based model to explore the equity of climate RESs in an Ethiopian smallholder farming system. Specifically, we study the potential effects of two RESs, involving access to seasonal climate forecasts and increases in non-farm job availability, on household food security under climate variability. We measure these effects in two distinct ways: “poverty-reduction,” which describes food security improvements relative to existing conditions; and “shock-absorption,” which isolates the strategies' effects on food security during and following a drought. Our results reveal that the different measures of resilience lead to divergent assessments of equity in policy effects. Relative to baseline levels of food security (poverty-reduction), both strategies disproportionately favor the most vulnerable households—i.e., they are equity-enhancing. Under this assessment, increases in job availability provide slightly stronger benefits to the most vulnerable households than climate forecasts. However, when isolating the effect of a drought (shock-absorption), both RESs benefit the moderately vulnerable households at the expense of the more vulnerable households—i.e., they are inequitable. These results demonstrate that a pure focus on poverty reduction may be insufficient to promote equitable development. Given the prevalence of climate shocks in smallholder systems, future studies of resilience should therefore jointly consider both poverty reduction and shock recovery, as well as the potential for inequity in the effects of RESs. •Resilience strategies should build resilience not just on average, but for everyone.•We assess resilience using an agent-based model of Ethiopian smallholder agriculture.•Climate forecasts and increased job availability benefit vulnerable households.•In the wake of a drought, both strategies create inequitable effects.•Both poverty reduction and shock recovery are important development objectives.},

  abstract = {Background. Asthma, a chronic respiratory condition affecting 8.2\% of the US population (2009), causes significant societal and economic burden, resulting in missed school/work days, activity limitations, and increased healthcare utilization. Annual asthma prevalence estimates are available from national surveys, but these surveys have not routinely collected asthma incidence data that are important for identifying risk factors and trends in rates of disease onset. The Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS), implemented in 2006, provides detailed asthma data that supplement Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. We analyzed BRFSS and ACBS data to estimate annual asthma incidence and to determine whether these rates differed by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity. Methods. BRFSS and ACBS data from the participating states during 2006-2008 (24 states and District of Columbia [DC] in 2006; 34 states and DC in 2007 and 2008) were analyzed to calculate 12-month incidence rates. Incident cases of asthma were defined as people diagnosed with asthma by a healthcare provider within 12 months prior to survey participation. Results. Estimated asthma incidence among at-risk adults was 3.8/1000, whereas that among at-risk children was 12.5/1000. Incidence among children aged 0-4 years was 23.4/1000, more than five times greater than that among youth aged 12-17 years (4.4/1000). Adult females had 1.8 times greater asthma incidence than adult males (4.9/1000 vs. 2.8/1000, respectively). Incidence among non-Hispanic (NH) White adults was 3.9/1000, among NH non-White adults was 3.2/1000, and among Hispanic adults was 4.0/1000. Conclusions. This is the first successful application of the BRFSS-ACBS during 2006-2008 to estimate asthma incidence rates from participating states and DC. As with known patterns in asthma prevalence, we found that asthma incidence was higher in children than adults, higher in younger children than older children and adolescents, and higher in adult females than adult males. However, we were unable to identify statistically significant differences in asthma incidence among most race/ethnic groups. As additional data on asthma incidence become available from the ACBS, these rates, coupled with ACBS data on symptoms, asthma self-management practices, and healthcare utilization, may help asthma control programs identify risk factors for disease development and target asthma prevention and control measures to populations most affected.},

  abstract = {Objective: Recent studies have made advances into understanding the complex agriculture work exposure environment in influencing asthma in adults. The objective of this study is to review studies of occupational agricultural exposures including dust, animal, and pesticide exposures with asthma in adult populations. Data sources: PubMed databases were searched for articles pertaining to farming, agriculture, asthma, occupational asthma, airway inflammation, respiratory disease, lung disease, pesticides, and organic dust. Study selections: Studies chosen were published in or after 1999 that included adults and asthma and farming/agricultural work or agricultural exposures and airway inflammatory disease measurements. Results: The data remain inconclusive. Several retrospective studies demonstrate agricultural work to be protective against asthma in adults, especially with increased farming exposure over time. In contrast, other studies find increased risk of asthma with farming exposures, especially for the non-atopic adult. Mechanistic and genetic studies have focused on defining the wide variety and abundance of microorganisms within these complex organic dusts that trigger several pattern recognition receptor pathways to modulate the hosts' response. Conclusion: Asthma risk depends on the interplay of genetic factors, gender, atopic predisposition, type of livestock, pesticide exposure, and magnitude and duration of exposure in the adult subject. Longer exposure to occupational farming is associated with decreased asthma risk. However, studies also suggest that agricultural work and multiple types of livestock are independent risk factors for developing asthma. Prospective and longitudinal studies focusing on genetic polymorphisms, objective assessments, and environmental sampling are needed to further delineate the influence of agriculture exposure in the adult worker.},

  abstract = {We present a unified framework to analyze the global convergence of Langevin dynamics based algorithms for nonconvex finite-sum optimization with \$n\$ component functions. At the core of our analysis is a direct analysis of the ergodicity of the numerical approximations to Langevin dynamics, which leads to faster convergence rates. Specifically, we show that gradient Langevin dynamics (GLD) and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) converge to the almost minimizer within \$\textbackslash tilde O\textbackslash big(nd/(\textbackslash lambda\textbackslash epsilon) \textbackslash big)\$ and \$\textbackslash tilde O\textbackslash big(d\^7/(\textbackslash lambda\^5\textbackslash epsilon\^5) \textbackslash big)\$ stochastic gradient evaluations respectively, where \$d\$ is the problem dimension, and \$\textbackslash lambda\$ is the spectral gap of the Markov chain generated by GLD. Both results improve upon the best known gradient complexity results (Raginsky et al., 2017). Furthermore, for the first time we prove the global convergence guarantee for variance reduced stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SVRG-LD) to the almost minimizer within \$\textbackslash tilde O\textbackslash big(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}d\^5/(\textbackslash lambda\^4\textbackslash epsilon\^\{5/2\})\textbackslash big)\$ stochastic gradient evaluations, which outperforms the gradient complexities of GLD and SGLD in a wide regime. Our theoretical analyses shed some light on using Langevin dynamics based algorithms for nonconvex optimization with provable guarantees.},

  abstract = {To perform large scale or complicated manipulation tasks, a multi-fingered robotic hand sometimes has to sequentially adjust its grasp status to overcome constraints of the manipulation, such as workspace limits, force balance requirement, etc. Such a strategy of changing grasping status is called a finger gait, which exhibits strong hybrid characteristics due to the discontinuity caused by relocating limited fingers and the continuity caused by manipulating objects. This paper aims to explore the complicated finger gaits planning problem and provide a method for robotic hands to autonomously generate feasible finger gaits to accomplish given tasks. Based on the hybrid automaton formulation of a popular finger gaiting primitive, finger substitution, we formulate the finger gait planning problem into a classic motion planning problem with a hybrid configuration space. Inspired by the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) techniques, we develop a finger gait planner to quickly search for a feasible manipulation strategy with finger substitution primitives. To increase the search performance of the planner, we further develop a refined sampling strategy, a novel hybrid distance and an efficient exploring strategy with the consideration of the problem’s hybrid nature. Finally, we use a representative numerical example to verify the validity of our problem formulation and the performance of the RRT based finger gait planner.},

Next, the reaction–diffusion equation that updates the level set function is derived and an optimization algorithm is then constructed, which uses the finite element method to solve the equilibrium equations and the reaction–diffusion equation when updating the level set function. Finally, several optimum design examples are shown to confirm the validity and utility of the proposed topology optimization method.},

We prove that our estimator achieves a near-optimal statistical rate of convergence even when the score function or the response variable is heavy-tailed. To establish the key concentration results, we develop a data-driven truncation argument that may be of independent interest. We supplement our theoretical findings with simulations.},

We will first convert the large-scale human-object interaction trajectories to robot demonstrations via motion retargeting, and then use these demonstrations to train CGF. During inference, we perform sampling with CGF to generate different grasping plans in the simulator and select the successful ones to transfer to the real robot. By training on diverse human data, our CGF allows generalization to manipulate multiple objects. Compared to previous planning algorithms, CGF is more efficient and achieves significant improvement on success rate when transferred to grasping with the real Allegro Hand.},

Automating tasks such as food handling, garment sorting, or assistive dressing requires open problems of modeling, perceiving, planning, and control to be solved. Recent advances in data-driven approaches, together with classical control and planning, can provide viable solutions to these open challenges. In addition, with the development of better simulation environments, we can generate and study scenarios that allow for benchmarking of various approaches and gain better understanding of what theoretical developments need to be made and how practical systems can be implemented and evaluated to provide flexible, scalable, and robust solutions. To this end, we survey more than 100 relevant studies in this area and use it as the basis to discuss open problems. We adopt a learning perspective to unify the discussion over analytical and data-driven approaches, addressing how to use and integrate model priors and task data in perceiving and manipulating a variety of deformable objects.},

Simulation results indicate that flip angle of the cat robot becomes larger with the increase of angle or angular velocity of swing legs. By contrast, the change of swing angle has more influence on flip angle of the cat robot. Adjusting angle and angular velocity of swing legs to suitable numerical values, energy consumption of turning motion can be reduced effectively.},

By making physics simulations end-to-end differentiable, we can perform gradient-based optimization and learning tasks. A majority of differentiable simulators consider collisions and contacts between objects, but they use different contact models for differentiability. In this paper, we overview four kinds of differentiable contact formulations - linear complementarity problems (LCP), convex optimization models, compliant models and position-based dynamics (PBD). We analyze and compare the gradients calculated by these models and show that the gradients are not always correct. We also demonstrate their ability to learn an optimal control strategy by comparing the learned strategies with the optimal strategy in an analytical form.
